### Our New Workshop

We've organized everything into 7 clear project buckets. The big question for tomorrow is to define the **one main goal** for each of the active ones.

**1. Hibiscus Studio:**
   - *What is its #1 goal right now?* 
   - (e.g., Land a new client? Finish the landing page?)

**2. Retail:**
   - *What is its #1 goal right now?* 
   - (e.g., Define the MVP? Find a test user?)

**3. Gas Solutions:**
   - *What is its #1 goal right now?* 
   - (e.g., Finalize the proposal? Identify a key contact?)

**4. Fitness:**
   - *What is the core idea in one sentence?*

**5. Personal Development:**
   - *What skill or system do you want to build next?*

**6. CRM Role (9-to-5):**
