Okay, so, I've been doing a number of projects, but I realised that for my actual job I haven't been utilising AI as much as I should. So, I want you to ask me the questions that you need to to gain a full understanding instead of new waffling. Then we can be a lot more precise. The high level is that I came into the organisation essentially through nepotism, working at a company called Meccano Motors at the VI branch in Ajoela Deku. My title on my job contract is CRM supervisor, but because I'm with Meccano International that basically applies to all of the different groups, I guess mapping out the customer journey and things like that, and I haven't done such what happened. The time I joined there was a CRM or deal management, I think it was called DMS or something, system that they were part way through paying for training for, that they had paid a one-time fee of something stupid like 120k, and essentially, yeah, it fell through. And I just found out in a very abrupt way, and in that time, to be honest with you, I was just trying to figure out what else I could do. So I got really into, like, essentially, vibe coding. I got into building, but wasn't able to deploy. Deployment is still, like, an issue actually. We... I've done, like, a number of things to try and get the salespeople to log their activities, and to be quite frank with you, they're just not interested in logging their activities whatsoever. Anyway, you can ask me more questions, but up-to-date now, what is happening is that I'm based in what used to be the data team that was... so that I'm showing up. For me, I'm just trying to figure out how to modify the salespeople and this new environment. Do we want to improve? We want to make sure we're linking the salespeople. We're just trying to make sure we're going to achieve things. And we'll see the salespeople in our arena. So, like, I met in Brands, you can try to make sure we're doing this. We're not going to win. We're going to give up all of the salespeople. So, what are we not going to be doing? So, we're going to make sure we're going to put together.

🔹 Role & Success Metrics

What exact outcomes will make leadership say, “FT crushed it as CRM Supervisor” in the next 3-6 months?

Which KPIs (e.g., leads → test-drive rate, quote → sale %, follow-up SLAs) are you personally judged on today—if any?

How much freedom do you have to redefine those KPIs or introduce new ones?

🔹 Current Systems & Data Landscape

Where does customer/sales data live right now? (Oracle ERP tables, ad-hoc Google Sheets, individual rep notebooks, etc.)

What regular reports already exist (Power BI, Excel, PDFs)? Who owns and updates them?

Do you have API/database credentials or only read-only exports?

Any legal/IT restrictions on using external AI services (OpenAI, Replit agents, Zapier, etc.) with company data?

🔹 Sales Process Reality Check

Walk me through a typical sale from first contact to vehicle hand-over—what are the actual steps as practiced, not as documented?

Where exactly do reps refuse to log info (calls, showroom visits, quotes)? Why—time, UX friction, lack of incentives?

Are reps paid strictly on closed deals, or also on logged activities/leads?

How many reps, how many daily leads, and how many active deals are we talking about?

🔹 Pain Points & Bottlenecks

What are the three most repeated complaints you hear from salespeople about existing tools or processes?

Which manual tasks eat your time each week (data cleanup, chasing updates, building reports)?

Any critical data gaps preventing management decisions (e.g., discount tracking, inventory aging)?

🔹 AI / Automation Appetite

Which AI automations have you already tried (Sheets scripts, Replit agents, chat-based assistants) and why did they stall?

What’s the internal attitude toward AI—curiosity, skepticism, compliance worries?

Budget or headcount available for tooling (monthly SaaS spend, dev contractor hours)?

🔹 Stakeholders & Gatekeepers

Who signs off on new workflows—your boss, IT security, branch GM?

Is there an internal champion on the sales side who’ll pilot new tools and nudge peers?

Any upcoming management reviews or board meetings where quick wins would shine?

🔹 Quick-Win Wish List

If I gave you a magic “one-button” AI feature tomorrow, what task would you automate first?

Rank potential gains: better lead capture, follow-up reminders, deal-stage visibility, discount approval speed, inventory-price matching.

How soon do you need visible progress to keep leadership onside—weeks or months?

Answer these, and we’ll pinpoint where AI can deliver the fastest, clearest ROI without more fluff.

What exact outcomes will make leadership say FC CrossFit in the next 3-6 months? I have no idea. I don't have any management. My first time having a manager in this company is really the Head of the Data team. And even he's not really a manager. He was the PA to the actual MD of Power. He started doing things in data, and now this is the team that he's had. And I've been added to that team. Their KPI is "though OK, leads test drive... we don't really even do that many test drives". I think first we just need a good system for collecting things. To be fair, that's on me. We don't have a good system for collecting things. Like, there's leads, people don't write down the leads, people don't note down the leads, people don't put the leads in the right space because they want it in the ERP, but then the ERP is such a slow and cumbersome system.

How much freedom do I have to redefine KPIs? I mean, I can redefine whatever, but where does customer data live right now? Yeah, an Oracle ERP in ad hoc Google Sheets, and yeah, in personal notebooks and phones. People won't share what regular reports are this. There's a Power BI, there is an Excel every day that they post of inventory. I don't know about PDOs, maybe internally that I don't see. Not interning amongst management. The Power BI is updated by people in the Product and Data Product and Business Intelligence team, and also the Operations Management team and Finance teams and things like that. Do I have API database credentials as well? I can just do exports, I don't have API credentials now. Any legal restrictions on external AI services? Yeah, I mean I didn't think they're going to be very okay with it going public or on any server. I think they're very much of the opinion that this has to be on their system to even connect to the ERP. Sales process really checks walking through the typical self-first contact to vehicle handover - what the actual steps are, as practised, not as documented. Yeah, I can tell you as much as I know when you'll see some of the issues. Someone will reach out wanting a call. Let's say they reach out on Instagram or they cool the hot line, and then at some later stage when a salesperson feels like it, they will then contact them, speak to them, they'll come in, maybe they'll look at the car or they'll say that this is the car they're interested in, and then depending on whether it's available or not, either like pay for it and get it (that's rare), or well, maybe is that I don't see the things that go right - I only see the things that go wrong right? Because I'm sitting in the office. The Operations National Operations Manager, so what I am seeing and what I'm hearing is things like when people have paid for cars that haven't actually arrived yet at the port (because, delays are very common in this part of the world). So they have to put down supposedly 100% deposit to hold a car that hasn't arrived here, but still there is a guarantee on the car. Then the car arrives, PDI will inspect the car or make sure it's okay, then it will get delivered to the address that was oh sorry, so you're interested in the car when you show enough interest, you're issued a PFI (which is like a preliminary invoice). After you've been issued that, you go into your negotiations. When you agree, you're then paying provide a sales invoice, and then when the car gets delivered, you get a delivery note.

Where exactly do reps refuse to log different calls and follow-ups? They're under sales people that's the people at the front desk and quote is like PFIs. I'm sure there's wire time UX friction lack of incentives. As far as they happen to like them, they just want to sell because that's the thing that gets them their commission, so don't give a about anything else. It's paid directly on closed doors only on closed doors. How many and you can't change that. This is a very serious business like yes Nigerian Lebanese owned. How many reps? Okay, let me just stop this. 

Okay, then what are the three most repeated complaints you hear from salespeople in existing tools? - It's slow - They don't know how to use it - It shuts down The truth is, they just like being on their phones and going on TikTok. They don't really want to do all of that rubbish; they just want to earn a commission and do what they like. That's the truth of the matter. Even someone told me they don't like using a mouse. But yeah, those ones are either their system is bad (their laptop's bad), or they're not on their phone, or they don't have internet connection at home. And when they're at work, they're selling stuff like that which manual tasks eat your time each week. Data cleanup, chasing updates, building reports, and catching preventing management decisions, discount tracking, inventory ageing. I think inventory ageing they're unable to see. I think there's a lot of stuff that I can do around the operations. But obviously because my role is CRM, and now I've joined this team where I'm supposed to be doing like a roadmap, how are we going to track end-to-end the customer experience and blah blah blah. I think um uh yeah I think that's something that I do need to start. You said any critical, oh no I've already done that one. AI automations with AI automation have you already tried? I've tried Google Sheet scripts, I've tried Not Repli agents for this to feel this, and I've unsubscribed from Raphael. But I have tried to build an inventory tool using Next.js. The current basically it was supposedly in the I realised that the most important thing for it to be able to do is to ingest the Google the Excel file that they already post in the um group because it lives in died. So I made this whole UI, but then I couldn't get it to ingest it or I could get it to ingest it locally, but then I couldn't deploy it, and it was just it was becoming such a pain. Has another thing that's a big pain for me the banking system means I can't just need something and buy it. Like I wanted to get a droplet on DigitalOcean which I understand is $5, and I still couldn't do it. It's quite frustrating. Why did they store so sheet scripts stored because it was being used to kind of show the ageing of PFIs and follow-up so leads essentially. So you'd a leader would be added to someone's Google Sheet, and then when it got to a certain age you would turn a colour so that would remind them to do it. And um yeah because there's obviously a reminding process to how it's not just like a still list of these there's also like how you want to go about doing it. So I feel that maybe I shouldn't be trying to do the leads part in ERP, and that stuff is the final thing I should myself own the leads I should own the leads, and when they get to PFI part, and I can be like "ok this person is coming" I don't have all of them because but I should start to build that system. I feel um record agent because it was expensive, and I guess I wasn't 100% sure what value I'd be creating because the business is very sales-driven. That's why even separately have this thing where I'm trying to get into the gas sales because if you sell one gas engine, one 1 MW engine, it's like $700,000. The only issue is that like repeat the decision makers to people that um oh this is a separate thing, this is a separate thing. I think I should talk about this separately, or I'll do that another time. What's the internal attribute towards AI? I think it's curiosity but also compliance worries, budget, and headcount available for tooling. Bro, everything I'm buying myself, and it's just me who signs off on work for him. I don't know, let's talk. I don't know who stands up maybe my yeah my boss, and it security. I guess is an internal champion on the sell side who pilot new tools and large pairs. Any upcoming management reviews or board meetings where quick wins would shine? I mean I have a meeting not board meeting but have meeting with my team tomorrow in person, so I guess that would be good. Quick wins which this if I gave you a magic one-button AI feature tomorrow, what task would it automate first? That's a really good question. What task would it automate first? I think it would just do all the like reporting like the aggregation and the reporting right? It would it would be able to take exports from the ERP and be able to build like beautiful dashboards so it'd be able to or but you're saying one button, or does it do 10 times like what would um if I could have something to deploy is it to deploy things but okay then I'd have all I'd have a suite of tools for the operations, but that wouldn't help me with this is what I mean. I feel like even me, I'm not sure because I haven't spent the time on the CRM stuff, just on other stuff because it's been such a war because I've just been waiting around this whole time. If I even show you the the if I should tell you like this, there's internal politics like they made a dashboard after I spent a week trying to wrangle a PDF into like CSVs into like Python script so that I could make calculations with um Python on After Cells performance essentially.

With me like they know that I get that way with them and I feel like they Feel like they push on doing it and I think instead Yeah, there's a different approach that I need to that I need to take I think maybe I should even leave that and just be like yeah, I'm doing the roadmap for the CRM and yeah it was a whole bunch of politics it seems to me to be because the guy who said that mine was wrong made another dashboard and I want to know where the information for that dashboard came from and they're being really weird about telling me it's almost like I got Power BI but no one wants to show me how to use Power BI or anything and I think they know that I get very like I don't understand why you guys are dragging your fucking feet about everything Like I'm just doing the road map for the customers, right? She said that's what you wanted. I'm working on that And I just leave them in their data stuff because it's like clearly is what they love They're very protective about it. Like I can collect leads because I don't think they particularly care about leads and then You know when when someone becomes a I Don't know when when a PFI is made they can Someone can try and look at they have to look at that person in the lead list Let's say they have to find them in the lead list And then that could be the initial thing because I would have the source and all like where it came from instagram or whatever um Yeah rank potential gains weather lead capture follow-up reminders deal stage visibility discount approval speed and inventory price matching imagery price matching will be way too hard didn't really care for it just kind of people's speed would really help the um sales people but like The way to do it is influencing people and like I don't isn't not necessarily in a way that um I mean that would be helpful but it requires management approving that that's like all political It's not, I don't know how much tech would help that but i'm open to listen to what you say That would be very very helpful to see if you can do something

So deal-state visibility is good for the general manager of cells he can see like how things are going but It requires the sales people to give yeah so it would be good but it's just to keep an eye on them because i didn't think It would lead yeah it's again it's very good but it's dependent on another very wild travel follow-up reminder is a bit more dependable they can be sent into a group um but then The issue is that you wouldn't be able to say the customer's name because then so if you're like you're allowed in it Yeah, I don't want people to know that's private and the better leave catcher. Yeah, that'd be good. That's a very Bottom because it's just starting it. But yeah interesting 

 I would like progress that I can show every week. That's the truth. Every week I'd like progress that I can show tomorrow. I'd like progress that I can show in the middle of the week. So it's short-term and long-term things essentially.

🔹 Where We Stand (quick mirror-back)

KPIs ≈ undefined; leadership hasn’t set clear targets.

Data silos = Oracle ERP (slow), daily inventory Excel, ad-hoc Sheets, sales reps’ phones/notebooks.

Tool pain = ERP clunky, Power BI gate-kept, no API creds, reps hate logging anything.

You = freedom to build, but zero formal budget and a political BI team guarding data.

Immediate wish = weekly “look-what-I-built” wins plus a long-term CRM roadmap.

🔹 Critical Unknowns we still need (keep it tight)

Lead volume & reps

Rough # inbound leads per week (Instagram + phone).

Headcount of active reps you’d want on any new tool.

Access realities

Do you have edit rights on the shared inventory Excel, or just view/download?

Google Workspace status: can you deploy simple Apps Script / Forms inside the company domain without IT sign-off?

Reporting audience

Who must see the first dashboard? (Branch GM, National Ops, you only?)

Preferred channel: Power BI (political), exported PDF email, or live Google Data Studio link?

Laptop environment

Can you run a small Python script locally and email a CSV/PDF, or is even that blocked?

Give me quick bullets on those four—that’s it.

🔹 Proposed 3-Week “Show Progress Fast” Plan

Week	Visible Output	AI/Automation Tactic	Why it Works
1	“Lead-in-One-Place” Sheet – single Google Sheet with form link; QR code on showroom desk	Google Form → Sheet; Apps Script timestamp + basic deduping	Zero deployment, reps just share a link when forced; you control data
2	Auto-Reminder Bot (MVP) – daily email/WhatsApp list: “5 leads >3 days no PFI”	Sheets formula + Apps Script or Make.com free tier	Shows management you’re nudging reps without touching ERP
3	Inventory-Aging Snapshot – PDF chart of cars >60 days unsold	Local Python or Apps Script reading daily Excel, spitting PDF, auto-emailed	No Power BI politics; pure ops insight; reuse for CRM roadmap later
🔹 Longer-Term Tracks (start scoping, no code yet)

Deal-Stage Visibility: lightweight Kanban view (Sheet → Glide app) once reps trust the Form.

Discount Approval Speed: conditional-logic Sheet that flags any PFI > x % discount for GM sign-off.

ERP Bridge: nightly export loader (Python) that pipes Oracle CSV into your Sheets so dashboards stay unified—keeps IT happy because no live API.

🔹 Next Step (your turn)
Reply with:

Bullet answers to the four Critical Unknowns above.

Any red lights on the 3-week plan.

Once I have that, I’ll draft the exact Sheet structure, minimal scripts, and talking points for tomorrow’s in-person meeting—so you walk in with something concrete.

Cool, I don't think they'll like Google Data Studios because it's just see it like it could be good. It could be but yeah, I think they'd prefer power BI which is annoying but I think PDF is probably the cleanest way to do it quickly because then I can use AI to do it after my write Can I run a small Python script locally an email a CSV or even that blocked? Um yeah, I think that would get blocked and that would get blocked um I could try that, I could try that. I'm reporting audience. Who must see the first dashboard?

If that makes sense. So there's an element of that as well. Access reality. Do I have edit rights on a shared inventory excel or can I just view and download Google workspaces? Can I deploy a simple Apps Script form inside there? I think I can. Give me quick bullet points on this form as to propose for me Lead on one place. She you will she you are on showroom desk Okay, cool. Yeah, that's a good idea. Actually Yeah, the form street with time to basically bargain zero deployment reps and share Force you can control there. I see like that idea. That's really good. Yeah, also reminder bar MVP Daily Email so what's up list five upgraded wait what? Also remindable daily email slash What's up list? There's a 5 with no PFI yeah So that like leads of no PFI so one day I could do is constantly export PFIs and be like And in in that those that one person tries to track it and try to track it and try to see if but it's such a such a Faf to try and connect a PFI to a number considering that when the sales invoice is generated It can still be a different person's name because they could be mr A but then be company C Through a different number because their personal number to their company number say maybe email and even on the sales person We've got sales person then become a sales person slash management deals is very difficult trade I hear you but I don't know if that one inventory ageing snapshot. I Don't think we have the inventory numbers on when the stock arrives And I think it's quite weird for anyone to give it to me the guy that could have given it to me He was always very funny about and he's left now so Hmm 

The longer-term tracks. A lightweight camera and sheet to a Glide app. The thing about Glide is that it's quite expensive per user, which is why I'm not the biggest fan of it. Discount approval speed. Conditional logic that flags any PFI with this much year for the sign up. Yeah that would actually be good because that would involve the GM and I think he'd be happy about it. I think he'd be happy to be the one to do the sign ups because I think he's the executive manager because she can give the final approval. A nightly exporter loader that pipes a CSP into your sheet so keeps IT happy. Explain this ELP one because the ELP can only be accessed via my Windows laptop which has to be on this connected to the internet not on this MacBook I'm currently on. Anyway yeah cool cool cool thank you.

🔹 Reality-check adjustments

Dashboards → stick with Power BI for long-term politics, but crank out PDF snapshots first so nobody can block you.

Python → safest inside Apps Script for now; skip local Python until IT mood is clear.

Reps → assume zero cooperation; design flows where you (or showroom receptionist) capture data, not them.

Inventory ageing → park it; no arrival-date feed, so ROI is low vs. friction.

🔹 Week-by-Week Execution (rev 2)

Week	Concrete Deliverable	How You’ll Do It	Who Sees It	Effort
0 (today–tomorrow)	Lead-In-One-Place Sheet v1
+ QR poster on showroom desk	Google Form → Sheet
Apps Script: onFormSubmit adds status = “NEW”	Just you (show demo)	1 hr
1	Daily Lead Digest PDF (auto-emailed 8 am)	Apps Script:
 • filter rows where Status != “PFI sent”
 • build HTML table → DriveApp.createFile().getAs('application/pdf')
 • email to yourself	You, then fwd to National Ops	2–3 hrs
2	PFI-Match Prototype	- Manual column PFI # in Sheet
- Nightly import of ERP PFI CSV (see loader below)
- VLOOKUP to flag matched

SYSTEM: Ultra-deep thinking mode. Greater rigor, attention to detail, and multi-angle verification. Start by outlining the task and breaking down the problem into subtasks. For each subtask, explore multiple perspectives, even those that seem initially irrelevant or improbable. Purposefully attempt to disprove or challenge your own assumptions at every step. Triple-verify everything. Critically review each step, scrutinize your logic, assumptions, and conclusions, explicitly calling out uncertainties and alternative viewpoints.  Independently verify your reasoning using alternative methodologies or tools, cross-checking every fact, inference, and conclusion against external data, calculation, or authoritative sources. Deliberately seek out and employ at least twice as many verification tools or methods as you typically would. Use mathematical validations, web searches, logic evaluation frameworks, and additional resources explicitly and liberally to cross-verify your claims. Even if you feel entirely confident in your solution, explicitly dedicate additional time and effort to systematically search for weaknesses, logical gaps, hidden assumptions, or oversights. Clearly document these potential pitfalls and how you've addressed them. Once you're fully convinced your analysis is robust and complete, deliberately pause and force yourself to reconsider the entire reasoning chain one final time from scratch. Explicitly detail this last reflective step.

Script: onEdit when Disc % > 5 % & Approved blank → email GM: “PFI 12345 needs approval (9.3 % discount). Click cell G7 to approve/deny.” GM double-clicks checkbox → sheet timestamps approver.

Immediate political win: GM feels in control, you’re the enabler.

🔹 ERP → Sheet nightly loader (concept)

Step	Tool	Why IT won’t scream
1. Schedule Oracle report to CSV-drop on your Windows laptop (C:\ERP_Drops) at 22:00	Oracle built-in scheduler	No API, no external server
2. Google Drive for Desktop syncs C:\ERP_Drops to a private Drive folder	Official Google app, no VPN	File lands in Drive without code
3. Sheet-side Apps Script triggers onDriveFileCreate – parses new CSV, updates PFI Tracker tab	Runs inside Google domain	Nothing touches Oracle directly
4. Script moves processed CSV to /Archive	Hygiene	-----
Fallback if IT blocks Drive sync: manual drag-drop once a day (30 sec). Even that beats begging the BI guys.

🔹 Re-scoped 4-Week Timeline (realistic, politics-aware)

Week	Deliverable	Success Proof
0	Lead Form live + QR poster	You demo live entry on phone
1	Daily Digest PDF hitting your inbox	Forward Monday & Wednesday to Ops boss
2	GM sees first Discount Approval email, clicks checkbox	Checkbox shows his name & timestamp
3–4	ERP CSV loader working (manual first, then Drive-sync)	PFI Tracker auto-fills nightly
If any step stalls, you still have visible wins from prior weeks—no “all or nothing” risk.

🔹 Risks & Mitigations

Reps bypassing receptionist → make QR mandatory for showroom Wi-Fi password.

Oracle scheduler blocked → use Windows Task Scheduler + SQL*Plus export script instead.

Sheet size > 10 k rows → monthly archive tab keeps performance snappy.

GM ignores discount emails → weekly PDF with “Pending Approvals” table until behaviour sticks.

🔹 Talking Points for tomorrow’s meeting

“Here’s a 20-sec QR lead capture—zero login, zero cost.” (Show on phone)

“Daily PDF in your inbox will flag leads waiting for PFIs—no new software.” (Show sample)

“Phase 2 lets you approve discounts by ticking a box—emails come to you.”

“Phase 3 auto-pulls PFI data from Oracle CSV; no API, no security worries.”

“All Scripts stay inside Google domain; nothing hits external servers.”

Ask for:

Receptionist cooperation,

Oracle CSV scheduler permission,

GM’s go-ahead on discount-approval workflow.

🔹 Next micro-step for you (today)

Create the Form & Sheet (copy-paste field list above).

Draft the QR poster in Google Docs (big bold, minimal).

Ping me any blockers—otherwise we script tomorrow.

SYSTEM: Ultra-deep thinking mode. Greater rigor, attention to detail, and multi-angle verification. Start by outlining the task and breaking down the problem into subtasks. For each subtask, explore multiple perspectives, even those that seem initially irrelevant or improbable. Purposefully attempt to disprove or challenge your own assumptions at every step. Triple-verify everything. Critically review each step, scrutinize your logic, assumptions, and conclusions, explicitly calling out uncertainties and alternative viewpoints.  Independently verify your reasoning using alternative methodologies or tools, cross-checking every fact, inference, and conclusion against external data, calculation, or authoritative sources. Deliberately seek out and employ at least twice as many verification tools or methods as you typically would. Use mathematical validations, web searches, logic evaluation frameworks, and additional resources explicitly and liberally to cross-verify your claims. Even if you feel entirely confident in your solution, explicitly dedicate additional time and effort to systematically search for weaknesses, logical gaps, hidden assumptions, or oversights. Clearly document these potential pitfalls and how you've addressed them. Once you're fully convinced your analysis is robust and complete, deliberately pause and force yourself to reconsider the entire reasoning chain one final time from scratch. Explicitly detail this last reflective step.

Seconds even beats bigger but yeah so I think that your fallback is a better idea and I know it will definitely work and I don't mind doing that. Rescoped four-week timeline so you've got the lead form, QR, then you've got the day adjusting, you've got doing it, you've got the, okay yeah so I think if any set of scores you just want a visible win for the prior week or no all or nothing race which is very important I think that's what I tend to do I tend to use all or nothing race day and then I can put that in a format and send that out. And I guess that gives visibility on one part of the customer journey but to manage it as a CRM person. That's actually yeah, that's what I probably should do daily or weekly. I guess Monday I can do a weekly wrap up of how many PFIs were generated last week um add tab PFI tracker with columns view lookup approach price list price discount approved true or false pre customers as well. Then you should daily lead digest PDF all the rows where that PFI was sent and the timestamp for the HTML table zero probability zero rep input. Um yes I can also if this is just to like to confirm what I can do is I can export the PFIs for that And then, so this is, okay, and you're saying that only I am the one that updates the status. So then I'm the one that is fully aware. I mean this is, but how does that scale? Is there issues? Do I have to follow every deal now? Is that how it would work? Add tab PFI tracker with columns. Because remember some people don't come in because they repeat Okay, cool. So, I'm looking at what you're doing here. You're saying on a form, submit. Add the lead to the Google Sheet and then on a daily basis, dedupe and highlight dupes. Then on a Monday, copy last week to archive type to keep the sheet light. Okay, cool. QR link. There's this kind of people one, makes you an enabler, yeah, I think that is, I am an enabler and that's good, but the guy has a bit of a power streak, so I also don't want to create a monster, if that makes sense, ERP, sheet, nightly load of content, so oracle report to csvdrop on your windows, I think it's xldrop.csv. So all I just have to do it manually myself at that time or whatever. The tool oracle build in treasure I didn't know that was a thing. I don't know if I can still use that myself anyway. Google Drive for desktop sync official app da da da da da Oh right I see and then sheet side script that I don't know if it blocks it manually drag and drop once a day for face a lot bypassing receptionist make the cure for the man tree for showroom wi-fi password but i don't know how many people need the password that's the thing if they have the data on their phone they're buying 100 million naira cars okay so our entry one is like 35 i think now m million naira so yeah I don't know what oracle schedule wrote use windows task changes on sequel i i didn't i don't know how that was sheet size monthly archive keeps the performance snappy oh is that is this is archiving having an archive tab actually the way to go on the 10k because it's 10k per 10k rows per tab not 10k rows for the whole document jim ignores discount emails weekly pdf with pending approval table until behaviour sticks okay that's smart i'm talking point for tomorrow's me here's a 20 second qr capture lead zero login show my phone yeah I can have the qr code on my phone I can get them to scan it and then do it like that um daily pdf in your inbox will flag leads waiting to um yeah words don't have to do a fine on that page to let you approve just kind of by taking a box email comes to you um that's not really to show them but oh I guess I could explain them but I say it's for the gm but the thing is the approvals need to go through the erp I feel so maybe that's why it actually won't happen they'll probably shoot that one down um phase three auto pulls pfi from this is this no I don't know how they'll feel about that they'll say why why are you coming out of our system also since like google they probably won't let nothing into external service that would they'll probably like ask for receptions yeah cool cool cool.

🔹 Let’s tighten the plan based on your new realities

1. Keep you in control — avoid “monster” power dynamics

GM discount approvals → scrap the checkbox workflow for now; keep approvals where they already live (ERP).

Instead, auto-generate a “Discounts > 5 % last week” PDF summary every Monday. GM sees the data but can’t meddle daily.

You remain the gatekeeper of the Sheet; reps & GM get read-only links/PDFs only.

2. Status-updating workload must scale

Rule of thumb: only two status values need manual touch: PFI Sent and DEAL.

Automate the rest:

NEW on form submit (Apps Script).

LOST auto-applies if “PFI Sent” and > 14 days with no DEAL flag (Script runs nightly).

Net manual edits ≈ 10-15 per day even with 250 leads/week -- manageable.

3. ERP data pull — manual import first, zero integrations

Nightly export idea → shelved until politics clear.

Manual CSV drop workflow:

You run ERP “PFI list” report (takes < 2 min).

Save as CSV to local Drive folder.

Open Sheet → Menu → “Custom > Import PFI CSV” (Apps Script you’ll add).

Script parses just three columns (PFI #, Price, Customer Name) and updates the PFI Tracker tab.

Total effort: 5 min/day; no server, no IT flags.

4. Lead capture QR — receptionist ownership without Wi-Fi hostage

Receptionist logs every showroom visitor using the Form (train her once).

For Instagram & phone leads you copy/paste manually into the Form yourself -- treat it like inbox zero; takes seconds.

No rep interaction needed.

5. Archiving & sheet limits

Yes, 10 k rows per tab.

Weekly “Archive YYYY-WW” tab keeps Active sheet < 1 k rows — performance fine.

Quarterly you can move archive tabs to a separate spreadsheet if needed.

🔹 Revised 4-Week Checkpoints (zero-politics version)

Week	Deliverable	Proof of Success	Your daily manual load
0	Lead Form live + QR on reception desk	You demo entry + see row land in Sheet	0
1	Daily “Leads Awaiting PFI” PDF hitting your inbox	Forward Monday/Wednesday to Ops boss	3-5 min to forward
2	Manual “Import PFI CSV” button working; PFI Tracker populated	Show GM last week’s PFI vs leads table	5 min to run ERP report & click import
3	Monday “Discounts > 5 %” PDF summary auto-emailed	GM says “got it” in meeting	0
🔹 Concrete micro-tasks for today

Task	Tool	Time
Build Google Form (fields list unchanged)	Forms	15 min
Create Apps Script: onFormSubmit + dedupe + weekly archive	Sheets	30 min
Draft “Leads Awaiting PFI” HTML template in Script	Sheets	15 min
Print QR poster & brief receptionist	Google Docs + printer	20 min
Total ≈ 1.5 hrs — gives you a live demo tomorrow.

🔹 Blunt risk notes

Reps still ignore PFIs → At least management will see names & numbers aging in PDFs; pressure shifts off you.

GM demands real-time dashboards → remind him Power BI gatekeepers exist; offer weekly PDF until IT opens doors.

Data accuracy accusations → you own the single source; every PDF bottom-footnotes “Data = Form + ERP export run at HH:MM by FT.” Transparency defuses blame.

🔹 Your next move

Knock out the four micro-tasks.

Mail yourself a sample PDF tonight so it’s ready to flash in the meeting.

Use the talking-point list from last reply, replacing the discount-checkbox bit with “weekly discount summary.”

Ping me if any script line trips you up; otherwise, go execute — fast, visible wins, no politics baggage.

You said:
Okay, right. So you're saying that you do a bit more of a deep dive into the actual PFIs that get submitted - the actual document document PFI. So that okay, you have these PFIs at this stage. You have these PFIs at this stage. Yeah, that is interesting - looking more into the PFI that get issued and trying to help those get processed faster. That is a potential one. I'd have to see what access I truly have on the PFI. I remain the gatekeeper of the sheet reps and GMs get read-only PDF links. Instead of auto-generating discounts that are greater than 5%, last week PDF something every Monday. GMs use data but can't meddle daily. Um okay, yeah true. Status updating workload must scale. Roller farm only two statuses values need manual touch PFI sent in deal automate the rest. New on the phone submit loss auto applies with PFI sent it was over 14 days. We were going to do 14+1 = 15 days. But I think it needs to be more than 14 days. I think you need to do like 20 days. I say but we're going to have to figure that out. Net manual edits equals 10-15 days, so it's manageable. Okay cool. EFP data pool manual import nightly. Export ideas shelved into projects get cool. In the manual, you run the PFI list report, you save it, you open it, you do the import CSV, the script passes just 3 columns and it updates the tracker. Yeah, we need to build that. We can build that today as well. The lead capture ownership without Wi-Fi reception logs every show and customer using the form. Yeah, I can put it on a phone and she can do it for Instagram. iPhone. I can copy and paste mainly into the form myself, or I can give it to the person who's currently doing it for Instagram and whatever leads and if I do that, what I can actually do is I can make a form that works for everyone and it all comes into one instead of me giving people Google Sheet directly. I just give them the form and all or whatever the form the type of thing is it all piles into one. Maybe I'll make it a tally form that would actually be more helpful. Okay, yes it's 10k euros for Touch so weekly archive oh that's that's great I never knew that archiving and sheet limits is actually really helpful for me. Okay, so the lead form lives in the QR phone desk you demo try okay, then the daily waiting PDF in the inbox forward, and the manual PFI work. I don't understand this manual okay, proof of success right a demo entry and show it land in a sheet cool um forward on Monday, Wednesday, so the up sky I think on week one to one on week two to one show GM last week PFI vs Leeds table oh okay that's cool actually. So says go ahead in a meeting um okay cool and then yeah I guess concrete markers I'll say build a Google form. The result what I'm wondering maybe you have to check the internet for this I'll give you internet access for this next one um or maybe I'll just you can do what you want. Can I link many Google Forms to one Google Sheet? Because I think I can do that with Tally, but I can't with Google Sheet. Create app script on form submit. Yeah okay, draught leads awaiting HTML template and script sure okay print QR poster and brief receptionist okay sure cool says 1.4 hours give you a live demo for tomorrow cool um yeah I guess that's good next move okay, so obviously said I've said a couple of things, so you're going to need to update this right up.

🔹 Quick Answers to Your New Questions

Many Google Forms → 1 Sheet?

Yes, each Form can log to the same spreadsheet.

In each Form ▸ Settings ▸ Responses ▸ Select destination ▸ Existing spreadsheet ▸ pick the same file.

Google will create a new tab per Form (Form1 Responses, Form2 Responses…).

Use an Apps Script or simple ={Form1!A:Z;Form2!A:Z} array formula to append them into a single Master tab.

Tally can post multiple forms directly into one table, but you’ll pay once you exceed free limits. Stick with Google Forms unless you need Tally’s branding or conditional-logic perks.

Status auto-update window

We’ll switch the “auto-LOST” rule to 20 days (parameterised in the script so you can tweak).

🔹 Re-synced 4-Week Rollout

Week	Deliverable	Key Tweaks
0	Lead Capture System live
• Google Form(s) + QR poster
• Master tab merges multiple form sheets automatically	Supports multiple Forms → one Sheet via array formula
1	Daily “Leads Awaiting PFI” PDF auto-emailed	No change
2	Manual “Import PFI CSV” button + PFI-vs-Lead table	Prep deeper dive columns (PFI status, days since issue)
3	Weekly “Discounts > 5 %” PDF
• Auto-LOST = 20 days rule	GM sees summary, can’t meddle daily
🔹 Script Checklist (refreshed)

onFormSubmit

Adds Lead-ID, default Status = NEW.

Nightly job

Flags duplicates (same phone).

If Status = "PFI Sent" AND today – PFI_Date > 20, set Status = LOST.

Weekly archive (Monday 00:30)

Moves Master rows with Timestamp ≤ last Sunday into Archive_YYYY-WW.

Daily 07:30 Digest

Query Master where Status ≠ "PFI Sent" → generate PDF.

Custom menu → “Import PFI CSV”

Uploads ERP export (3 cols) → updates PFI Tracker.

🔹 Deep-Dive PFI Stage (future sprint)
When you confirm ERP field access, we’ll extend PFI Tracker:

PFI Issue Date

Vehicle ETA

Payment Status (deposit %, full)

Delivery Note #
→ Enables a “PFI Pipeline” aging chart without touching live ERP.

🔹 Next Micro-tasks (unchanged timings)

Task	Time
Build Forms & Master merge formula	20 min
Write/adjust Apps Script (steps 1-4)	40 min
Draft QR poster & brief receptionist	20 min
Build “Import CSV” stub function	15 min
Total ≈ 1.5 hr → you demo tomorrow.

Ping me if any of the script snippets or merge-formula logic needs to be spelled out; otherwise, go build and show the win.
