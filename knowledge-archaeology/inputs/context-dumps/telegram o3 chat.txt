Ok, so what the idea is, is to first understand what the requirements are to have a Telegram group that has subgroups. So, an example of this is @levels, L E V E L S I O chat. This is an indie development Telegram chat that has subfolders, so similar to how Slack has channels, they essentially have channels within their group, so it’s not just one stream, it’s many. It has news, meetups, introduce yourself, remote jobs, marketing, mobile devs, and such. I should actually go through this.

The reason why we are looking at this is to understand if this would be a much more portable and scalable platform to have an MMS for a retail sales training, which will involve scenario tests, sending voice transcriptions, and other things that should be automatable via platforms such as n8n or just having scripts on a server. An example of a module could be sales objection handling, where there is some theory, then they can watch videos where scenarios will play, after which they can express their answers either as multiple choice or something else through a questionnaire. But thank you.

It’s also important that we’ll be able to track progress and they will be able to see their own progress and come back to where they left off. I want you to think around this problem and then ask me 10 clarifying questions about the idea in its general sense, as this is still in its infancy. From there, we will craft a message perfect for Claude’s deep research, and it will be able to build out a very smart MVP and scalable product that we could sell to all of the people on our program.

It is very important that even if someone else had a Telegram group, they would have the automations, the AI-generated videos, the language, and the groups of the community and management that we would have. Another thing that’s probably very important is that this will be one thing out of a suite of tools, and in that sense, one, there’s going to be other tools which will utilize the Telegram mini web app for something like check-ins and routines and also need a way to deliver the content over a spread of time, because if the person can just access everything all at once, yeah, it doesn’t really work.

Obviously, you also have things like notifications in Telegram, and you have like YouTube unlisted videos and stuff like that. So, next, you’re understanding, and you’re asking me the clarifying questions.

🔹 Quick snapshot of where we’re at
You’re exploring Telegram (using its Topics “sub-channels”) as the core delivery + community layer for a retail-sales training product that will drip out lessons, scenario videos, quizzes, voice-note assignments, progress tracking, and automated nudges via n8n/scripts. This will sit inside a wider tool-suite (mini-apps, check-ins, etc.).

🔹 10 clarifying questions to lock the requirements

Learner Volume & Cohorts

How many trainees do you expect per cohort, and will multiple cohorts run in parallel?

Access Model

Should each company get its own Telegram “workspace,” or will all clients share a single umbrella group segmented by Topics?

Curriculum Cadence

Do you envision fixed start dates with drip-fed content (e.g., daily/weekly unlocks), or totally self-paced access controlled by progress gates?

Assessment Formats

Which response modes must be supported? (MCQ buttons, open-text, voice transcriptions, photo/video uploads, etc.)

Grading & Feedback Loop

Who (human, AI, or both) reviews answers, and how quickly must feedback be returned to learners?

Progress Tracking Granularity

What exactly counts as “progress” (watch % on videos, quiz scores, completed reflections, time on task), and who needs visibility (learner only, managers, platform admins)?

Automation Stack

Which specific tasks must run hands-free (e.g., onboarding flow, drip scheduler, reminder pings, badge issuance, reporting to Google Sheets/CRM)?

Integration Points

Any must-have external systems (HRIS, LMS, payment gateway) that need real-time sync with Telegram data?

Security & Compliance

Are there data-privacy constraints (GDPR-type) or corporate firewalls that could block Telegram, and do you need SSO or role-based access beyond Telegram’s native admin/mod roles?

Scalability & Future Modules

How modular should the architecture be for plugging in new training tracks (e.g., product knowledge, leadership) without duplicating groups/automations?

Answering these will give us the parameters to brief Claude (or any research agent) and sketch an MVP that’s both portable and revenue-ready.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my request. How many trainees do I expect per cohort? And will multiple cohorts run in parallel? I guess yes, because some will be done through, we hope, Lagos Business School, but others will be done just because a client has paid for the service. How many trainees per cohort? I think anywhere between 5 to 100, I think, would make sense. Access model. Should each company get its own telegram workspace, or will all clients share a single umbrella group segmented by topics? I think I'm not too sure. It would probably make sense if there's a community channel, and then separately you have one that's kind of like your cohort, right? What are the downsides to my idea, and what would be a potential better way to approach this? Curriculum cadence. Do I envision fixed start dates with drip-free content, or totally self-paced, controlled by progress gates? Um, hmm. So, I think I should have the option of either. I'm not sure, because really, you're probably supposed to do self-paced. I feel like I just let management know, oh, by the way, these people, this is their progress so far. Something like that. Which response modes must be supported? Multiple choice questions, yes. Voice transcriptions, yes. Open text, of course, but I don't know how much to do with that. Photo and video uploads, yep, all of those. Grading and feedback. Who, human, AI, or both, reviews, answers, and how quickly must the feedback be returned to users? Because I think AI should do a lot of the heavy lifting, and then we can have it that, um, like AI's doing at least 50% of the heavier tasks. Realistically, we're having it that the human, whether it's us on the, like, product and admin, or, yeah, admin side, or managers on the manager user level, is looking at it. You said progress tracking, what exactly counts as progress? Percentage of watched video, quiz scores, completed reflections, time on task, and who needs visibility? Learner-only managers, so everyone needs visibility, but, like, the learners can't look at other people's, maybe. Or maybe we actually gamify it slightly, and you can see how you're progressing against your other peers. I think that would be quite good. Now, what counts as progress? I don't think percentage of a video watched, that would be too long, I would imagine. I think it's... Hmm. I mean, you watch a video, you complete a quiz, right? Or something along those lines. So maybe it's that complete reflections, that's like the video submissions where they talk about stuff. I think that should also be a score, right? So you have a quiz score, you have a reflection score. I don't know how we're going to do time on task, that one I'm not too sure on. That would be interesting, but, yeah. Automations app. What specific tasks must run hands-free? Onboarding, flow, trip, feeder schedule, reminder pings, badge issuance, reporting to Google Sheets. Yeah, all of them, really. I don't see why not. I'm open to any ones that you think should be. Integration points. And you must have external systems. Um... No, not really, like, worst case, we can do the payment manually if it comes to it. I don't think we need it. We're good, we're good. And do I need single sign-on or role-based access beyond Telegram's native admin mod roles? I don't believe so. If you think I do, sure, but I don't believe so. How modular should the architecture be for plugging in new training tracks, e.g. product knowledge, leadership without duplicating? Yeah, that's a... Yeah, it definitely should be scalable. It definitely, definitely should be scalable. And I want to know, what do you rate this idea? Like, you know, as... It's a problem... It's a challenge that I need to solve. I've currently even, like, lost a bit of the day because I seem to have misplaced my laptop cable. But I do think it has a lot of legs. It's a shame to turn that back to a lot of context. But if there's any other questions that you'd like to ask me, go ahead before you go ahead with the next thing.

🔹 Task breakdown – what has to work (and what can break)

Sub-area	Core requirement	Hidden assumptions & likely pain-points	Alternative angles / mitigations
1. Community layout	Single umbrella “HQ” + per-cohort Topics	• Topics only appear in groups ≥ 200 members (Telegram rule; you’ll need dummy users or rethink) 
telegram.org

• Mobile UI buries Topics two taps deep → newcomers miss them	• Create one super-group per client (unlimited Topics inside)
• Or Discord server → channels map 1-to-1 with modules (Threads = submissions)
2. Content drip	Time-gated lessons, auto-posted by bot	• No native “lock until date” → you’re writing the scheduler yourself
• Learners can scroll history and spoil later units unless bot deletes messages after window	• Use Telegram Mini Web App to serve lessons behind a JWT token & unlock logic; bot just sends deep-link
3. Assessment	MCQ, voice, video, open-text	• Inline-keyboard MCQ is trivial; voice & video need file-size handling (bots = 50 MB per file unless self-host Bot API) 
limits.tginfo.me
• For heavy media, collect in a Google Cloud bucket via signed-URL in Mini App; bot stores reference only
4. Grading / feedback	50 % AI autograde	• GPT can score MCQ & short text cheaply; voice needs STT first (cost spike)
• Edge-cases: network drop mid-upload, bilingual slang confusing STT	• Restrict reflections to text or 60-sec voice max; run Whisper-cpp locally; human spot-check failures only
5. Progress tracking	Dashboards for learner + manager	• Telegram has zero analytics API → you must mirror every interaction to your DB in real time	• Off-load to a lightweight LMS (Supabase + Metabase) and surface summary via bot /progress command
6. Automation stack	Onboarding, reminders, badges	• n8n works but hosting costs scale linearly with cohorts
• Telegram rate-limits bots to ~20 msgs/min per chat 
limits.tginfo.me
—reminder storms will stall	• Write core flows in Go/Node and trigger with AWS EventBridge; keep n8n for non-critical glue
7. Security / compliance	No SSO, minimal PII	• Some corporates block Telegram; LBS may allow only email-based systems
• Nigerian data-residency rules still fuzzy	• Offer web-only fallback (same Mini App) so firewalled users survive
8. Scalability	Plug-in new tracks without duplicating bots	• Topic list becomes unwieldy (>30) → cognitive overload	• One bot per track; bot spins up private topic when learner enrolls; archive finished topics nightly
🔹 Downsides of the “Telegram-only LMS” path

Governed by Telegram’s quirks – Topics threshold, media caps, rate limits, no built-in gating.

Analytics black hole – every metric you need (completion, scores, drop-offs) must be reinvented.

Content leakage – history scroll reveals future modules unless you add delete/expire logic.

Corporate IT friction – some clients simply ban Telegram; you lose the deal.

Vendor lock-in – migrate later = painful export of chats & file IDs.

User-experience gaps – serious learners may see a chat app as “noise”, not coursework.

🔹 Sharper architecture (Telegram plus, not Telegram only)

Core LMS micro-backend (Supabase or Firebase)

Stores lessons, unlock rules, submissions, scores.

REST endpoint GET /nextLesson?token= drives what learner sees.

Telegram bot as UX shell

/start ➜ JWT deep-link into Mini Web App viewer (clean, mobile-first).

Bot still hosts the community chat + sends smart notifications.

Topics strategy

One global “Announcements” topic (read-only).

Auto-spawn #cohort-XYZ topic per intake (archive after course).

Niche support topics (Jobs, Meetups) live in a separate public group so content noise doesn’t drown lessons.

Grading pipeline

MCQ graded instantly in-browser.

Reflections hit a queue ➜ Whisper STT ➜ GPT rubric ➜ score pushed to Supabase ➜ /progress bot card.

Gamification

Badge PNGs served from CDN, posted by bot on milestone events (rate-limit aware).

Leaderboard Mini App pulls aggregated scores; optional “anonymised alias” toggle for privacy.

🔹 Brutal honesty score

Dimension	10-pt score	Rationale
Speed to MVP	9	You can have a working cohort in <2 weeks using existing bot templates.
Long-term robustness	5	Scaling past 300 learners or corporate firewalls will hurt.
Differentiation	7	Voice-note AI grading inside Telegram is novel in Nigeria.
Exit-risk / lock-in	3	Content & analytics trapped in Telegram IDs.
Overall	6/10	Worth a lean pilot, but don’t bet the whole academy on Telegram alone.
🔹 Remaining gaps / final questions

Content IP – any reason you must keep videos inside Telegram (copy-protection) versus Vimeo private links embedded in Mini App?

Certification needs – do learners need printable certificates with verifiable QR links?

Budget ceiling – monthly hosting + OpenAI STT/LLM costs tolerance per 100 learners?

Moderator bandwidth – how many human graders can you realistically allocate per cohort?

Legal – will Lagos Business School require archival of chat logs for audits?

Answer these, and we’ll feed Claude a rock-solid spec.

Okay, so looking at your response, you're saying subarea or community layout, single umbrella HQ plus per cohort topics. Okay, hidden assumption. Very good. Topics only appear in groups greater than or equal to 200 members. Telegram foot rule. You'll need dummy users to rethink. The mobile UI buries topics two taps deep. Newcomers miss them. Ah. Alternative angles mitigations. Create one supergroup per client. Animated topics inside or a Discord server that maps one-to-one to modules. I think one supergroup per client is probably better than Discord for the types of users that we're thinking of, but I just wonder if it's a supergroup then how do you organize it, you know? Needed content drip. Time-gated lessons auto-posted by four. Okay, so they become inactive. No. Okay, so yeah, there's no native lock until date. You're writing the schedule yourself. Learn to control history and 12 later units unless bot deletes messages after window. You could use the Telegram mini web app to serve lesser tier. I think that mini web app idea we thought before. I'm in favor of that. Assessments. We have all these different assessments. Inline keyboard is trivial. Voice and video need size handling. Okay, so for heavy media, collect in Google Cloud Bucket via signed URL in mini. I don't understand your solution for this one when you said for heavy. Collect in a Google Cloud Bucket. What's a Google Cloud Bucket? I don't, yeah. Then you said 50% auto-grade. GPT can score MG3s very cheaply. Voice needs speech-to-text first, which will cause edge cases that will drop mid-upload. Bilingual slang confusing to text-to-speech. Yeah, that's true. Restrict reflections to text or 60-second voice max and run a whisper. CPP locally. Human spot check failures only. Fair. Yeah, I guess that does make sense. Doing that thing of keeping it. Yeah, anyway, that's a good idea. Progress tracking. A dashboard for learner plus manager has zero analytics API. You must mirror every interaction in a database in real-time. So we could offload this to a light LMS, Superbase plus Metabase and surface a summary. Yeah, we could, but I'm just not the biggest fan of databases. Like, because I'm not tech-deprived, rather something like a Google Sheet that I can look at easily. I don't know. Yeah, we need to find a friendly-to-me solution because I'm building all this myself. Automation stack. NAN works by hosting Costco linearly with cohorts. Telegram rate limits bots to 20 messages per chat. Okay, so write core flows in node and trigger with AWS vets. I don't understand what that means in go node, which I don't understand that. Sounds like this is actually, it doesn't make sense to do it with Telegram. I'm seeing a lot of issues and maybe there's a better tool than Telegram. Security. There's no single side on some corporate block Telegram. LBS may allow only email-based systems. They don't offer a web-only full-back mini app. So if I wouldn't, yeah, I mean, interesting, right? Like, could I just spin something up in lovable? All right. Am I like, but if I spin something up in lovable, how do I still make it mobile first? It has to be mobile first because of who it's for. Like, oh, what is, yeah, anyway. Scalability. Plug in new tracks without duplicating bots. One per track bot spins up private topics when NAN enrolls. What? Scalability plugin. Okay. So, topic list becomes unwieldy if it's over 30. Yes. So one bot per track. Yeah. I definitely agree with one bot per track. That's very smart. Downtime with the Telegram only governed by Telegram's quirks. Yep. Analytics, black hole, content leakage, corporate. Okay. So sharper architecture. Telegram plus, not Telegram only. So the core LMS micro backend is on to the base of Firebase. I almost feel like I prefer Firebase. I don't know. I don't know. I just don't like them. They're so technical and I've gone into these debugging holes before and not been able to do anything. Anyway, Telegram bot as a UX shell. So you start, you have the JWT deep into the mini app, which is a both host a community plus chat and send notification. Topic strategy, one global announcements, topic read only. Okay. But are you still saying that this topic strategy, what, that's not required to have 200 people in my group, right? There's a grading pipeline. The NCQ instantly grades it. Reflections here. Q. Yep. I agree. Don't. I agree on that. Badge PNG subs. I mean the badge, like we can come to that later. Brutal honesty. Speed to MVP. I don't know. It's 10, 10 point score. So you can have a working cohort in two weeks using existing templates. Okay. That's a good thing. Long-term robustness. Getting past 300 learners or corporate waffles will hurt. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Differentiation. Voice for AI is novel in Nigeria. So a seven. Okay. I think we need more differentiation points, but cool. Exit risk lock-in three. Content and analysis traps in our case. That's not good. And overall, you give us as a worth a lean player, but don't bet the whole academy on Telegram alone. Yeah. Fair. Remaining gaps to content IP. Any reason you must keep videos inside Telegram versus Vimeo Pro? No, it can be anywhere. I don't mind where it's hosted. Certification. Do you learn any printable certificates with QR code links? Yeah, but I can even do this separately, but yeah, that would be cool for them. Monthly hosting. Open AI cost tolerance for, yeah, I don't know. I mean, let's not, let's keep it under like a hundred dollars. Moderator bandwidth, one to two hundred dollars. How many human graders can you realistically allocate per cohort? I mean, if each person at the end of a big module has submitted three videos that are probably one minute each, that's three minutes. If you have, let's say you have five people in a thing. So that's for them to do a module, to do a whole thing. Five times 30 is 150 minutes, which is like two hours, two hours. How long does it take them to do a module? If you did a module in like a month, three hours, I don't, yeah. I don't know if they have the bandwidth to do three hours. Some do, some don't. And I think depending on the bandwidth they have, maybe that dictates how much AI does. Legal, will a retrieval business school require a high vote of chat logs for audits? They could. I don't know. Yeah, they could, to be honest with you. They could. I think we're still, we're still figuring this out, but you've done, you've done quite well. You've done very well. You've done very well.

Your 5-100-learner cohorts won’t see Topics unless you pad the head-count	① Fake “observer” bots to reach 200 (ugly) ② Ditch Topics and use bot-pinned inline menus instead ③ One super-group per client, where 200 is realistic
Bot flooding limits	20 msgs/min per group and 30 msgs/sec global

stackoverflow.com
Learners’ 1080p selfie-videos may stall	Accept only ≤ 60-sec clips, autocompress in Mini-App, or off-load to Drive/Cloud bucket
🔹 Google-Sheets-friendly architecture (no code PhD required)

Sheets as the single source of truth
Tabs: Users 💁, Lessons 📚, Submissions ✅, Scores 🏆
Glide, Softr, or Noloco can turn that Sheet into a mobile-first PWA in < 1 day.

Telegram ≈ notification + community shell

/start → deep-link opens the PWA lesson viewer.

Inline “Submit reflection” button drops a Sheet-row via Zapier (no Supabase).

Cohort chat lives in the same group; pin a “MODULE MENU” message that links back to PWA pages.

Assessments with zero dev-ops

MCQ: Google Forms → auto-grade → scores land in Scores tab.

Voice: learners record inside PWA (Mic Recorder JS), file is auto-uploaded to Drive; Zapier runs Whisper-API, drops text + score in Sheet.

Progress dashboards even you can tweak

Google Data Studio / Looker Studio connects to the Sheet → charts auto-update.

Learner /progress bot command simply screenshots (or links) their personal report page.

Drip scheduling

A single “Drip” column in Lessons with the day-offset number.

Daily n8n cron reads the Sheet → posts “Lesson 5 is live” + locks previous content by clearing the “Active?” flag.

Result: you stay inside the Google stack you already know, while Telegram handles only what it’s good at: chat + pings.

🔹 Differentiation moves beyond “just another chat course”

60-sec selfie challenges – peer-voted via inline-polls; weekly winner badge.

AI objection-handling coach – GPT role-plays a tough customer, triggered by /simulate.

Sales KPI ghosting – connect your client’s CRM sheet; bot DMs a “win story” when a learner closes a real sale.

Micro-certs with QR – every module completion mints a PNG certificate; QR links to a public verification page (Sheet → PWA).

Leaderboard with anonymity toggle – opt-in alias keeps shy learners engaged without privacy panic.

🔹 Five final lasers-focused questions before we spec the MVP

Content lifespan – Should completed cohorts retain read-only access forever, or auto-archive after X months?

Self-serve enrolment – Do learners sign up via Google Form / payment link, or does HR batch-import them?

Device constraints – Any learners on low-end 3G phones where a PWA heavier than 1 MB is a problem?

Grader SLA – Is “feedback within 48 hrs” acceptable, or do you promise same-day?

Audit trail – If LBS demands chat export, is a raw JSON dump okay, or do they want tidy PDFs?

Answer those, and we’ll lock the blueprint (sheet schema, Zapier recipes, PWA scaffold) and draft the Claude prompt to generate code snippets + video scripts in one go.

Okay, cool. So, this is the issue. Well, we just verified that Telegram confers topics to only when it, yeah, so, implication for you. It won't see unless I pad the headcount. Workaround fake observer bots to reach 200, which is ugly, to ditch topics and use bot-pinned inline menus instead. This, um, bot-pinned inline menus instead is actually quite a good idea, considering we're trying to reduce bloat. That could actually work. Um, bot flooding limits 20 messages per group and 30 messages per second global. Mash reminders or bad spam will silently fail. Okay. So, send in batches cron every 3 minutes or push most notifications via the menu. Yeah, if you think that'll work. If you could explain that to me a bit more, that would be useful. Upload teething. So, learners. Okay, so, accept only a 60 second clip. Autocompress, yeah, true. Is this stuff that we're doing in the mini app, is it becoming, like, unnecessary complicated? I do wonder this. Google Sheets friendly, no code PhD required. Goose is a single source of truth. You have a user's tab, you have lessons, you have submissions, you have scores. Glide, soft or no code can turn that sheet into a mobile PWA in a day. I actually forgot about glide and soft, that's a very good point, to be fair. Anyway, so, telegram is the notifications plus community shell. So, you start, deep loop opens the PWA, for example, glide or soft. Oh, right, I see what you're saying. And the inline submit reflection button drops a sheet row via Zapier. So, the cohort chat lives in the same group. Via pinned module message. I feel like I need to visually see some of the things you're saying, because I'm struggling now. I'm a visual learner, I'm an INTJ. Because this inline submit reflection and this cohort chat lives in the same group, I don't quite understand. Especially since there's zero DevOps, I can have Google Forms, the auto grade, and the score inline and the scores tab. Voice learners record inside the PWA. And the file is auto uploaded to the drive, Zapier runs and drops the text and scores it in a sheet. Nice. Progress. Again. One thing I think I want you to do as well. When I'm making a suggestion or when I'm saying something, you have to realize that I don't have a full breadth of knowledge of all of the ways in which I could do this. If, for example, you turn around and you're like, nah mate, Mighty Networks has all of this for $30. But then I don't have a defensible product do I? And then I have to focus on making the content really, really good. Which is still a possibility, but I just need to look at both options. Google Data Studio and Looker Studio. I mean, I think I can just first do visualizations of Google Sheets and stuff. But if it's in Google Sheets, it'll be easier. I don't know if I'm going to make these full dashboards. A single drip column in lessons with the date offset. A day and reads the sheet. Post lesson 5 is live plus logs of previous content by clearing the active. Post lesson 5 is live plus logs of previous content by clearing the active flag. Result, you stay inside the Google Stack. You already know what Typegram handles. You know what's good at chat and pings. Differentiation moves beyond just another chat post. You have the 60 second selfie challenges. You have AI objective handling. The GPT. Alright, yeah. You have the sales KPI ghosting. Connect to your client's CRM. Bot DMs a win story when a learner closes a real sale. I don't know where this KPI ghosting. I don't understand where that came from. Microsoft's a QR code. I don't think the QR code fully makes sense if it's coming on their phone. Lead the world with anonymity toggle. Yeah, it's not amazing though. I'm still not seeing it as being particularly easy for the user. This seems a bit complicated. Five final laser focus questions. Content license should complete a cohort. Retain read-only access forever or alter item after xbox. I think read-only forever. Self-serving enrollment. Do you learn this side up via Google form payment? Link orders. HR batch import them. Probably HR batch importing them. Device constraint. Any learners on low-end 3G phones with a P? I don't believe so because they're going to be in shops where people are buying expensive things so they're going to have decent phones. Because they get paid an okay salary. And also people still have like Android phones here. Like smartphones. Greater SLA. Is the feedback within fully hour successful or do you promise same day? You're probably right, we should promise same day. Audit trail. If LBS demands chat export, is a raw JSON okay or do they want? LBS probably doesn't even know what they want to that level. We have to think about that right now. Answer those and unlock the blueprint. I mean, I don't think we've locked in the blueprint yet. You can see that I'm just trying to see like, is this the best way to do it? Considering. Is this the nice in-between? This is where I struggle. It's all this planning stuff. It's telegram spot. It is building something. Okay, well, I will say lovable. I don't like double because I feel it's quite expensive for the number of. I feel that lovable is somewhat expensive for the number of messages that you get. I guess there is the chance of starting something in lovable, moving it to cursor and then doing it that way. But still, that's more like where about not just PWA and all these other things. Anyway, I think you can tease out where I'm concerned from this and we can try and figure it out.

🔹 How the pinned-menu flow actually works (no Topics required)

Bot posts & pins one master message

Inline-keyboard buttons: 📚 Lessons, 🎤 Submit Reflection, 🏆 Progress, 💬 Cohort Chat.

Learner scrolls? Doesn’t matter — the pin stays at top.

When user taps “📚 Lessons”

callback_data → bot DM’s a deep-link to your Glide/Softr PWA (https://pwa.app/#/lesson?uid=123).

Rate-limit safe: only one DM per tap.

“🎤 Submit Reflection”

Bot opens an in-chat form (Telegram Web App) or just a /submit prompt.

Voice note/video captured in PWA → auto-uploads to Drive (under 60 s, auto-compressed).

Zapier appends a row to Submissions sheet with file-URL + learner ID.

Reminders without flooding

Cron (n8n) grabs today’s “Due” list and sends one aggregated message every 3 min chunk (well below 20 msg/min cap).

Example: “@frank ⚠️ Lesson 3 quiz overdue” sent as a reply to the pin so nothing gets buried.

Managers’ view

They tap 🏆 Progress → bot DM’s Looker chart link filtered to their team only.

🔹 Why this is simpler than it looks

Zero custom hosting: Glide/Softr sits on top of your Google Sheet; Zapier handles file moves + Whisper call.

No Topics, no 200-user hack: Everything is surfaced via the single pinned card.

If Telegram ever blocks: Learners can still open the PWA directly from their browser and carry on.

🔹 Mighty Networks vs DIY sheet stack

Criterion	Mighty Networks	Sheet + Glide+Bot
Up-front setup	Minutes (turnkey)	1-2 days no-code
Monthly cost	$39-99	$25 Glide + $20 Zapier (~100 learners)
Custom AI grading	Limited	Full control (Whisper + GPT)
Vendor lock-in	High	Data lives in your Sheet
Differentiation	Hard (same feature set for all)	You own bot UX & AI coach
If “defensible product” matters, the DIY route lets you bolt on proprietary AI flows that Mighty can’t match.

🔹 Answered concerns & next concrete step

Visual map – see architecture diagram above for the data flow.

Cron batching logic – a single n8n “Remind” workflow loops through late learners and messages only 10 at a time → sleeps 30 s → repeats. Safe under Telegram caps.

Is the mini-app overkill? – Without it you’d be coding file-size checks, compress, STT in pure bot code. The PWA keeps that complexity off Telegram and inside Glide’s drag-and-drop.

🔹 Ready to lock the blueprint?
If this layout feels digestible, the next move is:

Blueprint doc: Sheet schema, Zapier recipes, n8n cron logic, pin-menu JSON.

Claude prompt: “Generate Glide table definitions + Telegram bot commands for…”

Just say “blueprint” and I’ll draft that doc with copy-paste-ready configs. 

You said:
Okay, so you said that the bot hosts or pins on MasterMessage. You have InlineKeyboard with Lessons, Submit, Reflection, Progress, Coholt Chat. LearnerSquad, it doesn't matter. It stays pinned. But what is it that's pinned? I understand InlineKeyboard, but I don't understand what... Anyway, so you tap Lessons, and then you get a callback. The bot DMs a deep link to Glide or Softr or something like that. I believe Glide is quite expensive for users, so I wonder what a cheaper alternative is. RadioSafe, only one DM per tap. And then, okay, it opens up the Lessons part for that UID. Makes sense. Then, Submit, Reflection. The bot opens an in-chat form. WebApp, and then you submit, and there's a voice for 60 seconds, and then it appends to the user. Okay. Reminders are fun. There's a quandary that grabs today's due list and says one aggregated message every three minutes. Well below 20 messages. So, at Frank is overdue sent as a reply to the pin, so nothing gets buried. That sounds quite smart, actually. Managers view their tap progress. At the bot DMs a looker chart, filtered. Does it have to be a looker chart, or can it just be in-chat, just like a... This is how people are doing name progress. I don't know if I will allow them to do a drawdown. They can request more later. Why this is simpler than it looks. Zero custom hosting. Glide software sits on top of your Google Sheets. Save your handles. Farm news almost for calls. No topics. No user. Everything suffers in a single pin. If Telegram ever blocks, Lions can still open the P2R objective from their browser and carry on. True. Okay, Mighty Networks, a DIY sheet stack. So, Mighty Networks is $39 to $99. Google Sheets plus Glide is one to three days with no code. And then it's like $25 for Glide and $28 for Zapier. We could do the vendor lock-in. Data lives in my sheets. Differentiation, hard-saving features set full. You own the UXPort and the coach. If defensible product matters, DIY will let you build... Let you bolt on proprietary... Yeah, okay. So, yeah, the visual map that you did was shit for me. Like, that's way too basic. Like, you're just doing arrows to boxes. You could have used Adasky Art. You could have used UFT8. Like, that would have been better, I feel. Cron batching or a single NAN. Do we have to use NAN for this? Like, it almost feels like doing all of this just use NAN. I haven't started using NAN yet. So, like, that's just another subscription visit needed. Is the mini-app overkill? Without it, you'd be coding file, size checks, compress. I'm not saying is the mini-app overkill. I understand that. I'm like, is the mini-app inside of Telegram the best way to do it or is there another way that you're suggesting? Ready to lock the blueprint? No. Obviously, we're still talking. Like, I've told you this thing about NAN. I've told you, like... Like, having Zapier and NAN, for example, that seems a bit unnecessary. And then you said, Code, command, generate, glide, table, definition, then code. No, no, no, no, no, no. Realistically, you and I going back and forth, and you doing enough, like, research, and it is actually doing what I would have done in Claude, which was a deep... What I was going to do in Claude was one big, deep research to be like, what is the best suggested, like, stack for what I'm doing? So, I guess you are getting more details on the question that Claude would do to verify, like, is this the best approach to the stack considering these constraints? And we've come up with this stack because of these reasons. And then whatever it says, I can then feed back to you, and we can see if it works. Does that make sense?

🔹 What exactly gets pinned?

It’s one plain text message posted by your bot (e.g. “📌 Course Menu – tap a button to navigate”).

Attached to that message is an Inline-Keyboard with 4 buttons:

┌────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ 📚 Lessons │ 🎤 Reflection │ 🏆 Progress │ 💬 Chat │
└────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
You (or the bot) then pin that message in the group → it lives at the top forever.

Each button fires a callback_data that the bot handles (DM a link, open a Web App, etc.).

No Topics, no 200-user hack, no extra clutter—just one fixed control panel.

🔹 Costs & lighter substitutes

Layer	My first suggestion	Cheaper / OSS swap	Notes
Mobile PWA	Glide ($25/mo, 2 k rows)	AppSheet “Starter” (free under 10 users) · Nocodery (free) · TinaCMS + Netlify (free)	All read/write the same Google Sheet.
Automations	Zapier + n8n	Google Apps Script (free) · Make.com (9 $/mo) · Self-hosted n8n on Fly.io (~2 $/mo)	If you’re already happy in Sheets, Apps Script covers row triggers + cron without new subs.
Dashboards	Looker Studio	Plain Sheet charts → bot sends as PNG · Grist (open-source)	Text-summary DM is even lighter.
Bottom line: With Sheets + Apps Script you can run the whole thing for $0 until traffic grows.

🔹 Killing Zapier + n8n

Apps Script onEdit → when a new row appears in Submissions, call Whisper/GPT via fetch and fill the Score cell.

A daily ClockTrigger loops the Lessons tab, finds anything with DripDate = TODAY(), and:

Posts “Lesson 5 is live 👇” into group.

Writes “Active = FALSE” on yesterday’s lesson to hide it in the PWA.

Another trigger builds a one-line progress string per learner and DM’s it.
All free, totally inside the Google ecosystem you already understand.

🔹 Answering your open points

Concern	Pragmatic answer
Mini-app overkill?	If you use Glide/AppSheet the “mini-app” is just a mobile webpage; Telegram opens it in-app but it also works in Chrome. No Telegram-WebApp coding needed.
Manager progress inside chat?	Yes: bot can DM a text block →
Frank: 3/5 lessons · Quiz avg 72% · 1 reflection pending.
Add /detail for CSV export later.
Cron batching without n8n?	Apps Script Utilities.sleep(2000) in a loop → stays under Telegram 20 msg/min cap.
KPI ghosting origin	Optional flavour: if you ever hook a client’s sales sheet, you can broadcast real-world wins to motivate learners. Ignore for MVP.
Visual learner request	See ASCII map above; if you want a richer FIG let me know which style (Mermaid, draw.io code, etc.) and I’ll output that.
🔹 What Claude needs to research now

Task: Recommend the lowest-cost, Google-Sheets-centric stack for delivering a drip-fed retail-sales course via Telegram, 
handling MCQ auto-grading, ≤60-sec voice reflections (Whisper), progress DM’s, and cron-safe reminders. 
Focus on: (1) Sheet schema, (2) Apps Script snippets, (3) Telegram Bot code samples, (4) compression options on mobile JS, 
(5) trade-off between Glide vs AppSheet vs pure HTML for the PWA.
If that captures the brief, say “run Claude” and we’ll fire it off.

You said:
SYSTEM: Ultra-deep thinking mode. Greater rigor, attention to detail, and multi-angle verification. Start by outlining the task and breaking down the problem into subtasks. For each subtask, explore multiple perspectives, even those that seem initially irrelevant or improbable. Purposefully attempt to disprove or challenge your own assumptions at every step. Triple-verify everything. Critically review each step, scrutinize your logic, assumptions, and conclusions, explicitly calling out uncertainties and alternative viewpoints.  Independently verify your reasoning using alternative methodologies or tools, cross-checking every fact, inference, and conclusion against external data, calculation, or authoritative sources. Deliberately seek out and employ at least twice as many verification tools or methods as you typically would. Use mathematical validations, web searches, logic evaluation frameworks, and additional resources explicitly and liberally to cross-verify your claims. Even if you feel entirely confident in your solution, explicitly dedicate additional time and effort to systematically search for weaknesses, logical gaps, hidden assumptions, or oversights. Clearly document these potential pitfalls and how you've addressed them. Once you're fully convinced your analysis is robust and complete, deliberately pause and force yourself to reconsider the entire reasoning chain one final time from scratch. Explicitly detail this last reflective step.

Okay, are you saying I press the pinned message and then the inline keyboard things come up, or the inline keyboard things are always there? You or the bot then pin the message in the group and it lives itself forever. Each message fires a callback. Okay, cool. Costs and lighter substitutes. So Glide PWA is 25,000 won to 2,000 euros. I could do AppSheet, which is free for 10 users, but you know I'm going to have more than 10 users. No Query, I have no idea what that is. I don't like Netlify, they have blocked my account for no reason, so we can't use them. No, it's all read and write, the same Google Sheet, yeah. So I could use Google Apps Script or Make or NAN. Yeah, I mean, I'm just saying that, like, it wouldn't be easy to just have NAN doing all of it, instead of Zapier and NAN and Make.com, that doesn't make any sense. If you're already happy with AppSheet covers, okay, we could also do Apps Scripts. Then Looker Studio, like, plain sheet charts, yeah. Yeah, that would be calm. DM Tech Summary. Okay, so bottom line with Sheet plus Apps Script, I get for zero dollars until traffic grows, and then what do I have to do when traffic grows? Okay, ASCII Art, this makes way more sense to me. Okay, so there's the learner, they have the inline button, they get the chron reminders, and there's a pinned menu, and a pinned menu over to DeepLink to Glide. And it reads and writes, and then you, okay, that, that, the ASCII map actually makes a lot of sense. I think from now on, this is how you should be showing things to me, because I actually understand this better. Killing the, okay, so Apps Scripts on edit, when a new row appears in submissions, call the whisper first, okay, call a daily clock trigger, loops the lesson times, find anything with DripJ equals today in post, lesson five is live into the group, writes active equals false on yesterday's lesson to hide it in the view, all three totally within, oh, that sounds quite smart. So, MiniApp Overcall, if you use Glide, that's actually the MiniApp, it's just a web page. It opens it up, it also works in Chrome, no telegram or recording needed, okay, fair. Manage your progress inside chat, yes, the bot can DM, like, this, um, cool. Cron job, Apps Scripts utilities, the, stays under the telegram, okay, cool. KPI ghosting, optional flavor, if you ever hook a client cell sheet, you can broadcast from the real-world wins to motivate learners. Yeah, I, I think we're not going to get that data from them. See the ASCII map, if you want a richer fig, let me know which style, um, no, I think how you've done it is good. The code research, I mean, first of all, I'm just looking at your code research, and it's already not that detailed, like, look how much we've been talking, like, this thing should be, like, a fucking masterpiece. You need to have thought way harder about the code research one. Recommend the lowest cost Google Sheet-centric stack for delivering a drip-free retail sales course via telegram. Handling all of these things, um, focus on Sheet Schema, Apps Script snippets, Telebrowser, compression options for mobile, Traders Resume, I mean, that's, that's not bad, to be fair, but I think you don't realize that Claude's deep research is able to look at, like, 500 sources, so give it enough clarity on what it's doing. I think you should even write your prompt, like, in a way that an AI could understand, so there's no mishaps, so, like, maybe write as JSON. Anyway, thank you, this is really helping me.

🔹 Pinned-menu mechanics (super clear)

The inline-keyboard buttons are baked into the message itself.

When you or the bot pins that message, the whole thing (text + buttons) lives at the very top.

Learner taps the pin → Telegram scrolls to it → buttons are immediately visible (no extra step).

Buttons persist for months unless you delete/replace the pinned message.

📌  Course Menu  (pinned)
┌───────────┬─────────────────┬────────────┬───────────┐
│ 📚 Lessons │ 🎤 Reflection  │ 🏆 Progress │ 💬 Chat  │
└───────────┴─────────────────┴────────────┴───────────┘
🔹 Cost path & what breaks when you grow

Phase	Users	Tech	Monthly cost	Weakest link	Upgrade path
MVP	≤100	Google Sheet + Apps Script + free Bot	$0	Apps Script quotas (6 min exec/hr)	Move logic to Cloud Functions ($0.40/million invocations)
Pilot	100-500	Add AppSheet “Starter” ($5/user) OR Softr Basic ($24)	$50-100	Sheet row caps (10 M cells)	Switch to PostgreSQL on Supabase Free, keep same front-end
Scale	500-5 000	Supabase + Cloud Functions + Looker Studio	$100-250	Telegram 20 msg/min cap	Shard cohorts across multiple bot tokens
Take-away: you can stay under $30/mo until you’re well past 300 active learners.

🔹 No-n8n option (all Apps Script)

onEdit trigger – when a new row hits Submissions, call Whisper API → write score.

Daily drip – ClockTrigger 07:00; loop Lessons sheet → post lesson links & flip “Active” flags.

Reminder loop – every hour; build list of overdue learners; for loop + Utilities.sleep(2000) to respect bot limit.

No extra subscriptions, no new UI to learn.

🔹 Cheaper PWA than Glide

AppSheet Core: free for prototypes, $5 user/mo once you exceed 10 users.

Softr “Personal”: $0 (1K records) – connects to Google Sheet, fully responsive.

Plain static HTML: generate pages via Sheet → JSON → GitHub Pages; cheapest but more manual.
Pick one, you can swap later—front-end is just a link.

🔹 Refined Claude deep-research prompt (JSON format)

{
  "role": "consultant",
  "task": "Design the lowest-cost, Google-Sheet-centric stack for a drip-fed retail-sales course delivered via Telegram.",
  "constraints": {
    "learners_per_cohort": 5_100,
    "content_types": ["MCQ", "≤60-sec voice", "text reflections"],
    "must_have": ["auto-grading", "daily drip", "progress DMs", "no-code preferred"],
    "budget_cap_usd": 30
  },
  "outputs_required": {
    "sheet_schema": true,
    "apps_script_snippets": true,
    "telegram_bot_samples": true,
    "mobile_upload_compression_options": true,
    "tradeoff_table": ["Glide", "AppSheet", "Softr", "static_html"]
  },
  "depth_expectation": "Use at least 20 authoritative sources or SDK docs; cite each. 2,000-word minimum."
}
Copy-paste that into Claude; it’ll know exactly what to fetch.

🔹 Next move

Decide which PWA builder you want to pilot (Glide, AppSheet, Softr, or raw HTML).

If the JSON prompt above looks solid, just say “run Claude now” and we’ll harvest the research.

I’ll then convert that research into step-by-step build instructions and working Apps Script snippets.

You said:
Okay, so he said the inline keyboard buttons are baked into the message itself. When you or the bot pin the message, the whole thing lives at the very top. Oh, I see what you're saying. It's a message with buttons, and that stays at the top. I understand now. So Leona taps the pin, it scrolls up where it becomes immediately viewable, and the button persists for months. I get what you're saying now. That's the course menu. Nice. That is very smart. Course path and what breaks when you grow. So when I get over 100 users, the Google Sheet plus apps for free breaks. Oh, no, this is, okay, right, weakest link, the outcourses of six minutes. Okay, so move to cloud functions. I don't understand cloud functions of Google. How much does it cost? Is it something that I can, like a vibe code, right? I don't do things in a technical space by hand manually, so I can do it quicker. So is that going to make sense? On the pilot, my app sheet starter. No, see, I don't want to do $5 per user. That's expensive, even how it was the cost per user on software. I don't like that. I don't like that. And you said we could see the road caps of 10 million cells. I don't like that either. Switch to Postgres. Okay, so that's what I need to now switch to a proper database. And then when it's 5,000 to 5,000, my monthly cost goes up. Weakest link is Telegram. Now shared cohorts across multiple. You can stay under $30 until you're well past 300 active. I mean, this does concern me. It does concern me, I wonder. Just for context, right now I don't have access to my laptop, but I've been trying to learn about MCPs. I'm really pissed because I even heard that Loveable was free this weekend and I could have bought it. It was really annoying. Or at least I could have played around with Loveable, but it's fine. This is stuff for me from getting the rabbit holes that I'm just talking to you and drilling down, drilling down, drilling down. No NAN option called All Apps Scripts. When a new row hits a mission, etc, etc, etc. Anyway. Cheaper PWA than Client AppSheet. No, because even 20 users is now expensive. Personal. Softer personal. Plain static HTML generates pages via JSON to GitHub. Explain this plain static HTML with GitHub Pages to me. Yeah, that might be quite smart. Okay, so your role, consultant, design the lowest. Yes, you have done now the same thing that you did before as a JSON. Well done. But like I'm still saying that this should have this should be like at least three times as long with like so many other points. You need to think about like deep, deep research. You're like, what have we? You haven't explained why we're doing MCQs. You haven't talked about the thing that we figured out when we made the decision on the pinned message. You haven't spoken about all of the concerns that I have in terms of. What's going to break and like the fact that I'm non-technical and I'm trying to build this and, you know, you haven't gone to all of that depth. You didn't actually decide which PWA builder we haven't decided. Yeah, you're explaining to me the HTML role one. If the JSON propped above looks solid, just say run. I've already told you about that. Then you'll convert the reaches into step. Yeah, I mean, we're still very much not at the Claude stage yet. We're still getting there.

🔹 How the pinned-menu actually looks

📌  Course Menu (pinned message)
┌────────┬─────────────┬────────────┬──────────┐
│ 📚 Lessons │ 🎤 Reflection │ 🏆 Progress │ 💬 Chat │
└────────┴─────────────┴────────────┴──────────┘
That single message is what’s pinned. The buttons are always visible when a learner taps the pin.

🔹 Plain-static-HTML route (zero SaaS fees forever)

Publish the sheet as JSON

Apps Script endpoint:

function doGet(){      
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById('SHEET_ID');  
  const data = ss.getSheetByName('Lessons').getDataRange().getValues();  
  return ContentService  
    .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(data))  
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);  
}
Deploy as web-app → you now have https://script.google.com/macros/s/XYZ/exec.

Static site generator

Clone a free Eleventy / Astro template.

JS fetches the JSON above → renders a mobile-first lessons list.

Vanilla <form> posts reflections to another Apps Script doPost() that appends to Submissions sheet.

Host on GitHub Pages – unlimited bandwidth, custom domain, $0. 
pages.github.com

git push auto-deploys.

Optional: add a GitHub Action to rebuild pages nightly (pull fresh lessons).

Why it stays free

GitHub Pages = free static hosting.

Apps Script quota (per user): 90 min exec/day – enough for ~1 000 learners.

No paid PWA builders, no database limits.

🔹 When growth breaks the free tier & what to swap in

Break-point	What fails	2-minute fix	Annual cost after swap
> 90 min Apps Script/day	Quota	Move heavy jobs to Google Cloud Functions 2nd gen – first 2 M invocations/mo free, then $0.40/M. 
economize.cloud
modal.com
± $5 at 10 M calls/yr
> 10 M sheet cells	Sheet	Export to Supabase free tier (500 MB PG)	$0
Telegram 20 msg/min cap	Reminders	Spin up a second bot token; segment cohorts 1-N	$0
🔹 Softr vs AppSheet vs Static-HTML (cost & effort)

Free cap	After free	Uses your Sheet	Effort for non-coder
Softr	1 000 visitors, 3 apps 
softr.io
softr.io
$59/mo basic	✅	Drag-drop (easiest)
AppSheet Starter	Prototype (unlimited)	$5 / user / mo 
about.appsheet.com
googlecloudcommunity.com
✅	Medium (editor UI)
Static-HTML	Unlimited	$0	✅ (via JSON)	Harder: copy-paste template + slight JS
Your stated constraints (low budget, non-coder, >10 users) → Static-HTML first, slide to Softr if you need visual builder later.

🔹 Cloud Functions 101 (for a non-coder)

Think of it as “Apps Script on steroids.”

You upload one JS file; Google runs it on demand.

Pricing (2nd gen, 2025): first 2 M calls free each month, then $0.40 per million invocations; same region egress free. 
economize.cloud
modal.com

Deploy from browser:

gcloud functions deploy dripScheduler \
   --runtime=nodejs22 --trigger-http --entry-point=handler
Trigger via Cloud Scheduler (cron) or webhook from Telegram.

🔹 Why MCQs + ≤ 60 s voice?

Reasoning:

Auto-grades instantly → dopamine loop for learners.

≤ 60 s keeps voice uploads under 5 MB even in AAC, well below Telegram’s 50 MB bot limit.

Whisper cost ≈ $0.006/min – sane at scale.

Alternatives considered & rejected:

Long-form essay ↔ manual grading overhead.

Image uploads ↔ no cheap OCR scoring yet.

🔹 What still needs your decision

Pick the starter front-end – Static-HTML template or Softr free?

Name the sheet tabs – final columns for Lessons, Users, Submissions, Scores.

Feedback SLA – 24 h or same-day? (sets cron frequency).

Certificate style – PNG via Apps Script or skip for MVP.

Reply with your choices and I’ll draft:

the Sheet schema (column A-Z)

the exact Apps Script functions (copy-paste)

the pinned-menu bot code (Python-telegram-bot sample)

No Claude yet—we’ll only hand off once those four bullets feel watertight.

You said:
Okay, so you showed me how the pinned menu would actually look. That makes a lot more sense. Stay in Plastic Zero at SAS V's forever. So you publish the sheet as JSON and deploy it. Wait, the sheet? I don't understand. You publish the sheet as HTML. What do you mean you publish the sheet? I thought you were saying you publish like a website that has... so it's... and deploy it as a web app. You now have script.com, macros, this, this. I don't understand that. Clone a free template. JS fetches the JSON above and renders a mobile-first lesson. Vanilla form, post reflections to it, and then you host on Google Pages and you push it, optional. Why? It stays free because it's free hosting. There's only enough for a thousand learners, and then there's no PWA builders and no database limits. So this sounds really smart, but I think I've... the way you explained it, I'm not fully understanding what it is. When growth breaks a free term, when to swap. So when we... the 90-minute Apps Scripts per day move heavy jobs to Google Cloud Functions. First 2M is free. I don't know what that means, though. I don't know how easy it is. The number of sheets so we can export to Superbase free to a certain point. I'm scared about that. Should I just do it first in Superbase? How do I... yeah, I'm not sure. Telegram 20 messages, cap reminder, spin up a second bot to segment cohorts 1-n. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know how easy it is to do that, but that makes sense. Where am I hosting these bots as well? Software vs. Adversaries. It sounds like the static HTML is smart. Your state is a country of low budget, non-coder, and more than 10 users to static... HTML, yeah, it seems so. Think of it as Apps Scripts. Upload one JS file, Google runs it on-demand, and it deploys and you trigger via the cloud. I didn't know about that. That seems smart. Why MMCQs also graze interleaved dopamine for loofahs? What's the cost of this? Sane at scale. You have alternatives? No. I don't want the alternatives. I like those. What still needs your decision to pick the starter front-end? I just need you to explain this HTML file better for me and then we can get into it. It sounds like it's smart and that I can easily change it. Explain it to me. Give me the full user flow as an ASCII. I click here, I click lessons, and then somehow or other it shows me my latest lesson that I haven't completed. Where it's a page, I go through it, I then finish, or I submit something, or I record something, or something else. I click submit, it gets saved to a Google Sheet with a link, I get told, I get auto-graded, I come back, and my manager gets notified. Is that how it works? Name the sheet tabs, final columns for lessons. I mean, it's up to you, you can figure out those. Feedback yesterday, 24 hours on the same day. I think 24 hours is fine. Reply with your choices and I'll draw up the sheet schema. I mean, I don't need to see your code, see if it's right right now. We can do that later. No code yet, we'll only hand off once we have those four. But it's for watertight. Yeah, we're getting there. I like that saying, actually, watertight. Because there's no air when you're underwater. That's very smart. I like that. By the way, I'm doing a voice transcription and then sometimes I have a pre-prompt that you can see. I think where you think it makes sense, you should be applying that pre-prompt. I don't have to paste it in every time. If there's any blind spot you feel that I'm having in how we're talking about this, because I only have one shot to really build this really well. It doesn't have to be really well in the sense that I can't fail. We are iterating, but you can see that this is so much faster than me wasting time. I want you to make sure you're understanding everything I'm saying as well. Because anytime I say something about myself, about the project, about my ability, about my thinking, that you don't understand, you don't have to ask me only three or four questions. You can ask me a question about anything. Thank you.

🔹 What “publish the Sheet as JSON” actually means

Write one tiny Apps Script (doGet / doPost)

/**
 * GET → return Lessons sheet as JSON
 */
function doGet() {
  const ss   = SpreadsheetApp.openById('YOUR_SHEET_ID');
  const rows = ss.getSheetByName('Lessons').getDataRange().getValues();
  return ContentService               // native Apps Script class
           .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(rows))
           .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
Deploy → New → “Web app”
Who has access? Anyone
Apps Script hosts it at

https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx…/exec
Every time your front-end hits that URL it receives fresh JSON straight from your Sheet. (Same trick works for POST to append rows.) 
developers.google.com

In lessons.js:

fetch('https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbx…/exec')
   .then(r => r.json())
   .then(renderLessonList);
Vanilla <form> on each lesson page posts to another Apps Script doPost() which appends [timestamp, userId, lessonId, answerLink] to Submissions sheet.

PWA goodies (optional) – add a manifest.json + service-worker for offline caching; Chrome will offer “Add to Home Screen.”

Result: mobile-first site, zero monthly fees, fully under your control.

07:00 daily → drip today’s lessons, archive yesterday, send reminder list (loops with Utilities.sleep(2000) to stay under 20 msg/min cap).

🔹 Hosting the Telegram bot itself

Stage	Free option	2-line upgrade later
MVP	Replit → “Always-On” flag (covers ≈ 3 k msg/day).	Move python-telegram-bot file to Fly.io or Railway (≈ $1/mo at idle).
Scale	Docker image on Cloud Run – first 2 M invocations free then $0.40/M 
modal.com
Horizontal auto-scaling; env vars for multiple bot tokens.
You don’t touch Kubernetes; it’s one docker run.

🔹 Sheet tab + column blueprint

Users

Lessons
| A id | B title | C video_url | D mcq_json | E drip_day | F active |

Submissions
| A ts | B user_id | C lesson_id | D answer_link | E mcq_score | F reflection_txt |

Scores (Apps Script writes)
| A user_id | B completed | C avg_mcq | D last_reflection | E badges_json |

🔹 Remaining open items (need your call)

Front-end template – pick one:

eleventy-base-blog (super light)

astro-docs-starter (also fine)

Certificate PNG – yes/no for MVP?

Manager notification channel – private DM or separate manager-only group?

File-size cap – keep hard 60 s AAC (≈4 MB) or raise?

Clarify those four and I’ll deliver:

the exact Apps Script files (copy-paste)

static-site repo skeleton (link ready for git clone)

bot sample (Python) with pinned menu + callbacks

🔹 Think of the “Sheet → JSON → Website” chain like a vending machine

Layer	Human-language picture	What you (non-coder) actually do
1. Google Sheet	Your master list of lessons — just rows in a spreadsheet.	Fill columns: id, title, video URL, quiz ID, drip day.
2. Apps Script “window”	A tiny window that lets the outside world read those rows (and write submissions).	Copy-paste 15 lines → Deploy as “Web app”. Google gives you a long URL that spits out JSON (basically your sheet in computer-speak).
3. Static HTML site	A simple webpage that asks the window for today’s lessons and paints them nicely on the phone.	Download a free template → in one JS file change the JSON URL to yours → push to GitHub. Done.
Nothing else is running — no database server, no expensive builder. Your Sheet is the DB.

🔹 Full learner journey (no code-speak, just clicks)

Learner opens Telegram → taps pinned “📚 Lessons”.

Bot sends a link (e.g., lessons.ftacademy.com/?u=123).

Link opens a clean mobile page:

Video at the top

3-question multiple-choice quiz

Big red “Record reflection” button (auto-stops at 60 s).

Learner hits Submit.

Behind the scenes:

The page sends answers + audio file to Apps Script.

Apps Script adds a new row in Submissions.

Same script notices the new row, calls Whisper + GPT, writes the score.

Bot DM’s the learner: “✅ Lesson 12 graded: 8/10”.

Bot DM’s the learner’s manager (private): “FT just cleared Lesson 12 – 8/10”.

That’s it — no weird redirects, no log-ins beyond Telegram.

🔹 Answers to your open points

Question	Decision / Option	Why it fits your constraints
Front-end template	Start with eleventy-base-blog (HTML + a single JS file). You can redesign later in Cursor; it’s just HTML/CSS.	
Certificate PNG	Skip for MVP. Add later when flow is proven.	
Manager notifications	Private DM per manager. Scales no matter how many managers; no messy group spam.	
Voice length / size	Keep hard 60 s (≈ 4 MB AAC). Cheap for Whisper and fast on 3 G devices.	
MCQ JSON bulk	Store questions in a Quiz sheet (id, q, a, b, c, correct). Lessons sheet links by quiz_id. Keeps the row small.	
Bot hosting	Start on Railway free tier (or Fly.io) – one click, $0 until you hit ~1 GB-hours/month. Replit only if you like its editor.	
🔹 What I’ll deliver next (once you say “go”)

Sheets blueprint (4 tabs with example rows + share settings).

Two Apps Script files

api.gs – serves JSON + receives submissions.

grader.gs – onEdit trigger → Whisper + GPT call + DM.

GitHub repo skeleton

index.html, lesson.html, lessons.js (already wired to your JSON URL).

Python-telegram-bot sample

Creates the pinned menu, handles callbacks, sends links/DMs.

Deploy cheat-sheet (Railway + GitHub Pages screenshots).

Zero billing until you grow past ~300 actives.

If this clicks, reply “build the pack” and I’ll paste the copy-ready code + folder links in the next message. Still fuzzy? Tell me which step feels risky or unclear and I’ll zoom in again.

Thought for a few seconds
🔹 Let’s zoom-out and restate the whole idea in plain English

Spreadsheet = database.

Lessons tab is just a list: “Lesson 1, link to video, quiz #5, goes live on Day 3.”

Users tab lists each learner’s Telegram ID and cohort.

Submissions tab records answers.

Tiny Apps Script = doorway.

When a web page (or the bot) calls the doorway URL, it hands back the rows of Lessons as simple text (JSON).

When a learner submits a quiz, the same doorway accepts the answers and drops them into Submissions.

Static website = shop window.

A single HTML file asks the doorway “what lessons are live for me?” and shows them.

It’s just files on GitHub Pages → free, no server.

Telegram bot = tour guide.

Keeps the pinned menu at the top.

Sends each learner the personal link to the static site.

DMs scores and nudges.

Everything else (grading, reminders) is handled by short Apps Script triggers that run in the background.

🔹 Why the Lessons JSON looks scary but isn’t

The learner never reads that JSON; your static page does.

Example entry returned:

{
  "id": 12,
  "title": "Overcoming Price Objections",
  "video_url": "https://youtu.be/abc123",
  "quiz_id": 5
}
The page then fetches Quiz 5 from the Quiz sheet and renders the MCQs.
→ You avoid stuffing huge JSON blobs in the Lessons tab.

🔹 Static-site folder in real life

repo/
├─ index.html       ← just “Welcome, tap lesson”
├─ lesson.html      ← template for a single lesson
├─ lessons.js       ← tiny script that fetches your JSON, fills lesson list
├─ mic.js           ← handles 60-sec recorder + uploads to Apps Script
└─ style.css
You will mainly edit the HTML/CSS; the JS files are <100 lines each and I’ll hand them ready-wired.

🔹 Decisions we’ve now locked

Item	Your choice
Template	You’ll redesign later; start with barebones Eleventy scaffold.
Certificates	Skip for MVP.
Manager alerts	Private DM per manager.
Voice length	60 s hard cap (≈4 MB AAC).
MCQ storage	Separate Quiz tab (one row per question).
That leaves no open branches.

🔹 What still might feel fuzzy

Fuzzy bit	Reality check
Google Cloud Functions	Ignore for now. Apps Script free quotas cover ~1 000 learners. We’ll move only if you hit that ceiling.
Supabase worry	Not needed at MVP. Sheet handles 10 M cells (~100 k lessons/answers).
Bot hosting	Railway free tier = paste token, click deploy. ($0). Move to Fly.io later if needed.
🔹 Ready for the build pack?

If what you see above finally clicks, just reply “build the pack”.
You’ll get:

4-tab Google-Sheet template (share link).

Copy-paste Apps Script files.

GitHub repo starter zip (HTML + JS wired).

Minimal Python bot file + Railway deploy steps (screenshots).

All in one message.
If any part still feels off, tell me which row in the table above and I’ll drill into that only—no extra fluff.

Okay, so first of all, can you show me what you mean when you say a list? Can you give me like a visual illustration using ASCII art? This tiny app script equals doorway. I understand the two points you made, but I don't understand what you mean by doorway. Oh, you're using an analogy that I don't think actually helps, to be honest with you. A single static HTML file asks the doorway what lessons are live for me, and it shows them. It's just files on the app. Oh, I see. That makes a bit more sense. And the tall guys are telling me what pins there are. I think you could have a better analogy, but I think I understand a bit more. Why the lesson JSON looks very recent. The learner never uses JSON. Your static page does, for example. Oh, okay. This page then fetches those files from the sheet and renders the MCQs. You avoid stuffing huge JSON blobs. Fair enough. Then you're showing me the static folder in real life. Welcome tab lesson template for a single lesson. Tiny script that fetches your JSON and handles the recorder. Decisions. We've now locked. Voice length. Things that are still fuzzy. Cloud functions. What hosting. Ready to build. If you want to see. I want to see the whole thing or as many screens as you can show me through ASCII art. I think that will be the thing that makes me fully clear.

├─ lesson.html     (template)
├─ lessons.js      (fetch JSON → fill cards)
├─ mic.js          (recorder + upload)
└─ style.css

Apps Script
├─ api.gs    (doGet  = JSON, doPost = save submission)
└─ grader.gs (onEdit trigger → grade + DM)

Railway Container
└─ bot.py    (Python-telegram-bot, pinned menu, callbacks)
