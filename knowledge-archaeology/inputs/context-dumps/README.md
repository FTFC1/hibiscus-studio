# Context Dumps

This directory is reserved for any external context you want to share (e.g. ChatGPT / Claude conversations, screenshots, notes).

1. Simply drag-and-drop your files here in Cursor or copy them into this folder from your file manager.
2. Use clear filenames so we can reference them easily, e.g. `crm_brainstorm_chatgpt_2024-06-15.txt`.
3. If a file needs extra explanation, create a matching `*.meta.md` file with the same basename.

Once files are in place, just ping me and I'll ingest them. 🤖
