# 🛍️ FORJE Retail Certification – Knowledge Hub  

> Last updated: 2025-06-12  

## 🔹 Overview  
The **FORJE Retail Certification** initiative is building **Nigeria's first professional, transferable qualification system** for frontline retail staff.  Mobile-first learning modules (5-10 min) are paired with monthly manager-led role-plays and bi-annual external assessments.  Outcome → uplift in conversion, basket metrics and career pathways.  

## 🔹 Current Objective  
Secure a **pilot retailer** (5-20 store fashion / lifestyle chain) and validate the v1 certification loop (Level 1–3).  Deliver measurable behavioural change and at least **+10 % uplift** in the chosen sales KPI within 6 months.  

## 🔹 Key Decisions ✓  
1. **Pilot partner open** – LBS Fashion programme proposal logged but not mandatory. Sourcing alternate chains.  
2. **Landing page rebuild** – New marketing site will replace legacy Netlify prototype.  
3. **Training archive v002 is draft** – Final asset pack still in production.  

## 🔹 Working Model (draft)

  A["Self-paced micro-lessons (mobile)"] --> B["In-store role-play sessions"];

  C --> D["External assessors – bi-annual"];

  E --> F["Career progression & salary band"];
```  
• **Manager vs External weight:** *30 % internal / 70 % external* – figure derived from **Abu interview** (65 managers, 275 staff ⇒ ~2 h/month review capacity). Pending final confirmation.

2. Update `retail_ambiguities.md` when decisions are made.  
3. Run `python3 scripts/retail_scan.py` after significant file changes to refresh the profile/map.
