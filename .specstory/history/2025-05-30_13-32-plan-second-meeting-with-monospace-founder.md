# Plan second meeting with Monospace founder (2025-05-30 14:32:59)

_**User**_

So I've just had a conversation with the founder of Monospace, which is a Nigerian digital agency. We're looking at building a number of tools, workflows and products using AI in order to help Meccano to just elevate themselves generally and to be the leading automotive company in Nigeria. I want you to look at my Trello board. I want you to make a card. I want you to add the following items to the checklist, which is to have the meeting with the founder Friday 30th of May at midday to also ask him what platform or how he is going to do the WhatsApp bot. Then to also send him the link for the Virgil Abloh presentation and also to align on the next follow up actions. These should all be part of one checklist, which is going to be called second meeting. So meetings 002. Okay.

So you have made one mistake which is that you've made a checklist in the description but I actually want you to use your MCP tools that allow you to make the actual checklist items.

You're absolutely right! I created a markdown checklist in the description instead of using the actual Trello checklist functionality. Let me fix that properly by creating an actual checklist with real checklist items.

First, let me update the card description to remove the markdown checklist:

Looking at the available MCP tools, I can see I have `get_checklist_details` but I don't see the tools for creating checklists directly. Let me check if there might be additional functionality or if I need to use a different approach. 

Could you help me understand which specific MCP tool I should use to create the actual checklist with the name "Meetings 002" and the four checklist items? I want to make sure I'm using the correct tool that you're referring to. 🤖
