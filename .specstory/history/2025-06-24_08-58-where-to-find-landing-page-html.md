🔹 **Landing Page Files**

I found a few potential landing page files. Based on their names and locations, these seem like the most relevant ones:

*   **Hibiscus Studio:** [`projects/01-hibiscus-studio/landing/index.html`](mdc:projects/01-hibiscus-studio/landing/index.html)
*   **Retail TM:** [`projects/02-retail/retailtm-landing/index.html`](mdc:projects/02-retail/retailtm-landing/index.html)
*   **Forje Certification:** [`projects/02-retail/01-CORE/forje-certification-landing/index.html`](mdc:projects/02-retail/01-CORE/forje-certification-landing/index.html)

There's also a duplicate of the Forje Certification page here:
*   [`knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/Retail/01-CORE/forje-certification-landing/index.html`](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/Retail/01-CORE/forje-certification-landing/index.html)

Do any of these look like the one you're searching for?
