Before you run this in Cursor, three quick prep steps:

Gather your materials for the Gas Turbines project:

Export your gas-related conversations from ChatGPT/Claude/Grok
List all relevant files in your Gas Cursor folder
Note which files might be outdated


Set up your Cursor project structure:
knowledge-archaeology/
├── inputs/
│   ├── conversations/
│   └── project-files/
└── outputs/
    └── gas-turbines.json

Add this to the prompt's start:
"Project: Gas Turbines Lagos
Files: [list your files]
Conversations: [paste exports]"

You're about to turn chaos into clarity! This will give you that "command center" view of what you actually know vs. what's still in flux.
Ready to run this archaeological dig?|




Prompt: Prompt Purpose:
Guide an LLM (such as Claude in Cursor) to conduct a structured “archaeological dig” through a single specified project’s files and conversation exports, extracting and organizing key decisions, considerations, and cross-project insights into modular JSON profiles, and outputting a visual (ASCII) map of the project’s knowledge landscape. The system should handle ambiguous cases by batching them for user review, and accommodate tangential or ADHD-style discoveries.
Context:
You are an INTJ digital builder and product designer with ADHD traits, who manages multiple ongoing projects. Your files include markdown documents, exported conversations (from ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc.), and voice transcripts from WhisperMemos. Projects are often deep in progress with overlapping, sometimes outdated, information. You want a modular, portable, and up-to-date JSON knowledge system that can be leveraged by any AI agent, and a visual representation to help you quickly see connections and gaps. You value flows that minimize redundant effort and support nonlinear, tangential thinking.
Instruction:
1. Review all provided files and conversation exports within the specified project folder.
2. Extract the following elements:
   - Key decisions (clear, finalized choices)
   - Considerations or explorations (~)
   - Tangential or cross-project insights (especially where discoveries in one area may apply elsewhere)
   - Conflicts or duplicates (e.g., differing specs, repeated topics, outdated files)
3. Classify each extracted element as:
   - ✓ Clearly a decision (finalized, actionable)
   - ~ Clearly a consideration or exploration (not finalized)
   - ? Ambiguous—needs user input
4. At the end, batch all ambiguous items (“?”) and present them together for user review and classification.
5. Build a modular JSON output for this project. Structure should support:
   - Project-level summary
   - Decisions array (each with id, decision, reason, date)
   - Considerations array
   - Cross-project-insights array (with references)
   - Conflicts array (with file/version references)
6. Surface “side discoveries” (ADHD/tangential findings) in a separate section for review.
7. Output an ASCII visual map showing:
   - Project nodes and their relationships
   - Key decisions as solid lines
   - Considerations or open questions as dashed lines
   - Cross-project links as bridges
   - Conflicts in red (or labeled clearly)
8. Throughout, minimize assumptions—always ask for clarification on ambiguous material in a single batch at the end.
Output Format:
1. Modular JSON file (per project) with the following structure:
{
  "project": "PROJECT_NAME",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "summary": "...",
  "decisions": [{ "id": "...", "decision": "...", "reason": "...", "date": "..." }],
  "considerations": [{ "id": "...", "text": "...", "context": "..." }],
  "cross_project_insights": [{ "id": "...", "insight": "...", "related_projects": ["..."] }],
  "conflicts": [{ "type": "...", "details": "...", "files_involved": ["..."] }],
  "side_discoveries": [{ "id": "...", "note": "...", "relevance": "..." }]
}
2. ASCII visual map showing:
   - Project structure
   - Decision and consideration flows
   - Cross-project connections
   - Highlighted conflicts
3. Batch list of ambiguous items for user review/clarification.

Okay, so specstory is what has your chats, that will give you a better idea of what is new and what isn't. I think you should look at specstory, and then that should help you understand what's new and what's not.

At a very high level, essentially we're moving away from cold email and trying to think about how we can do cold calling. And also how we can cold call or get the numbers to cold call. By understanding that, you'll probably be like "Okay, so you know companies that we found are probably still useful, but trying to go this email route is secondary to first trying to do emails". The latest latest update which is something that we haven't quite figured out how to do yet is to do geographical search (so you find a road that has a lot of estates and hotels and you think that would be a great place to supply power to) instead.

I want you to look at the file itself as well, so that you can understand it better.

🔹 Pulled chats into the dig workspace  
`knowledge-archaeology/inputs/conversations/history/…` now contains the entire SpecStory log set (≈ 10 MB).

🔹 Key take-aways from the **latest** sessions (Jun 3 – 10)  
• Pivot from cold-email ➜ phone-first lead packs (50 verified numbers/week).  
• Claude “deep research” + Firecrawl HTML fetch = core data engine.  
• Pipeline sketch: URL discovery → Firecrawl scrape → regex/Claude extract → Numverify/WhatsApp ping → VA spot-check.  
• Content repurposing (PDF briefs) is secondary marketing, not LinkedIn-centric.  
• Geographical targeting idea emerging: scrape by road/estate clusters.

Older sessions (May 31 and earlier) focus on email sequences, MCP scoring, and healthcare power calculator—still useful for company lists but now **secondary**.

🔹 Next prep moves  
1. Copy **project files** you deem essential into `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/`  
   – e.g. `lead_gen_system/`, any CSVs, company lists, regex scripts.  
2. Tell me which files (or whole folders) you consider **outdated** so I can tag them.  
   – I’ll mark those as “conflict/outdated” for the JSON.  
3. I’ll then run the full “archaeological dig” prompt to generate:  
   • `outputs/gas-turbines.json` (modular knowledge)  
   • ASCII map of decisions / considerations / conflicts  
   • Batch list of ambiguities for you to classify.

Give me the include/exclude list (or just say “grab everything now”) and we’ll kick off the dig. 🤖

_**User**_

So one thing I will say to you is that we're currently doing this for the GAS project but you're obviously aware that we have other projects like you can just use the Trello MCP to understand but we're focused right now on the GAS one. So for example your conversations you should probably have a subfolder which is like GAS project just so that it's understood a bit better. And you're seeing that the entire specstory is around 10MB nice to note.

Key takeaway from the latest session: Pivot from call EME to claw deep research. We're not doing the firecrawl, it's just claw deep research. Pipeline sketch, so you need that pipeline sketches now. We're not going to firecrawls are unnecessary because it can just get HTMLs, it can just look at sites but it doesn't do the thinking afterwards that claw deep research will do.

Then you said content repurposing PDF briefs is secondary marketing. I mean yeah, it's an idea and this geographical targeting geographical targeting then using that to get the numbers or how figuring out how we're going to get numbers and then so on and so forth. All the sessions older sessions will older sessions we still want logs but of course like we're slowly getting to a point where we're logging our decisions so that we can have a chronology of what the decisions are.

Next steps you're saying are copy the project files I deem I mean the whole point is because you can go through this faster so I don't want to deem it too short is you can ask me questions and I will say it and you can then use that to deduce what is outdated and then you can do the dig and then do the output no problem. It's a collaborative process not and it's leveraging on what you can do by looking deeply into the files.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 Conversations organised  
`knowledge-archaeology/inputs/conversations/GAS/history/…` now neatly holds the 10 MB SpecStory logs.

🔹 Updated pipeline note  
• We’ll drop Firecrawl. Source discovery + extraction handled entirely via Claude Opus “deep research” prompts.  
• Pipeline v2 (high-level):  
  1. Claude: fetch & rank URLs + scrape + reason.  
  2. Regex / Claude pass to isolate 🇳🇬 phone numbers, roles, confidence.  
  3. Numverify / WhatsApp-lookup for validity.  
  4. Human spot-check 5 % sample.  
  5. Deliver CSV + optional WhatsApp intro service.

🔹 Need your quick steer on these before the dig  
1. **Folders to include**: Shall I ingest everything under the GAS repo (lead_gen_system, Database, Templates, etc.), or are there chunky assets (e.g. zip, older scripts) you already know are obsolete?  
2. **Geographical-targeting files**: Do we have any folder/file already experimenting with road-based scraping, or is that pure idea right now?  
3. **Phone-number code**: Any existing regex or enrichment scripts you’ve started that I should tag as “current”?  
4. **Cross-project links**: Any other repo that heavily influences GAS (e.g. Trello MCP configs) you want referenced inside the JSON?

Answer as bullets—“include X”, “exclude Y”—and I’ll ingest accordingly, then kick off the archaeological extraction and produce:  
• `gas-turbines.json` knowledge profile  
• ASCII map  
• Ambiguous-items batch for review. 🤖

_**User**_

You're not quite understanding. Essentially, like we haven't figured out how you actually get Nigerian numbers like that's still a big thing. Yes, we have this like verifying and then you know optional WhatsApp interest. But first is like how can we make sure that we actually get numbers that work? We're still trying to figure that out, and you needed a quick state.

For us to include each other in everything under report or other chunky assets zip or older script, you already know obviously I think you should look at things and just keep asking me. I didn't you can ask me as many questions as you want, I don't mind. You don't have to just ingest everything and put it and make everything clunky. I want you to actually look and then often questions. Do I have a folder file already experimented the road-based scraping was it a pure idea? So it's an idea that came from someone who's actually like been in Nigeria for a long time quite small that's where I came from. I want to try out any existing rejects or original scripts. Know cross-project links are any Reaper that heavy influence gas no it's just that was I'm doing it here because this is obviously connected to my trailer so I figured this is actually the best place for me to begin this. Yeah and I'm not answering as bullets because I'm doing a voice transcription but I know you can still understand no issue.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 Quick clarity check – help me avoid dragging dead weight  
1. MCP scripts (`lead_gen_system/tools/scripts/*.py`) – still part of the future, or mostly legacy email-era code?  
2. Database → `ACTIVE_LEADS/…` CSV + JSON lists from May 29 – treat as “current raw companies” or archive?  
3. `power_roi_calculator.html` / `lead_generation_dashboard.html` – useful artefacts or can we skip?  
4. `nigerian-manufacturing-intel.zip` – keep or junk?  
5. Any *existing* phone-number scrapers hiding elsewhere, or do we start greenfield?  
6. Any other folder outside `Gas` that definitely impacts this project today?

Fire back short answers (keep / skip / unsure). I’ll tag accordingly and run the dig. 🤖

_**User**_

Amazing, so yeah these MCP scripts are legacy email era stuff because we're not necessarily doing cold email. The active leads list from me should be treated as the current role companies. I feel like it would be good if we had a roll-up of all the companies because the companies are obviously older than my idea, they're still valid most probably. Like the time was taken, the credits were used, so maybe it just needs to be reformatted.

The Power ROI Calculator HTML is a useful artefact? Yes. The lead generation HTML I don't think is useful anymore. The Nigerian manufacturing Intel.zip I think is junk. Any existing phone number scrapers hiding elsewhere? No. Any other outside guess? Any further outside guess that definitely impacts a project today? Not to my knowledge, no.

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 File-selection summary  
• KEEP  
  – `/Database/ACTIVE_LEADS/**` (all CSV / JSON lists) – treat as current raw companies  
  – `/lead_gen_system/tools/power_roi_calculator.html` – useful artefact  
  – `README.md` (root + GAS) – context  
• TAG AS LEGACY (outdated)  
  – `/lead_gen_system/tools/scripts/*.py` + any email-era MCP servers  
  – `lead_generation_dashboard.html`  
• SKIP / DELETE  
  – `nigerian-manufacturing-intel.zip`  
• No phone-number scrapers found elsewhere.

🔹 Plan for the dig  (automated steps)  
1. Copy the KEEP items into `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/GAS/`.  
2. Roll up all company CSV/JSON files into a single normalised table (dedupe on company name), mark as `companies_master.csv`.  
3. Run the archaeological-dig prompt over:  
   • SpecStory chat logs (now in `conversations/GAS/`)  
   • Project files selected above  
4. Auto-classify Decisions ✓, Considerations ~, Conflicts, Side discoveries.  
5. Produce:  
   • `outputs/gas-turbines.json` (modular knowledge object)  
   • ASCII map of the knowledge landscape  
   • Batch list of ambiguous items (questions about phone-num pipeline, geo targeting, etc.) for your review.  

All good? If yes, I’ll execute the copy/cleanup and start the extraction. 🤖

• Selected assets copied to `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/GAS/`  
  – `ACTIVE_LEADS/…` (CSV + JSON lists)  
  – `power_roi_calculator.html`  
  – the (old) `README.md` for reference  
• Legacy email MCP scripts + dashboard flagged as “outdated” (kept in place, but will be tagged).  
• Junk file `nigerian-manufacturing-intel.zip` ignored.  

🔹 Next automated step
I’ll run the “arch-dig” process, which will:
1. Scan SpecStory logs + selected files.  
2. Roll-up all company CSV/JSON files into a deduped `companies_master.csv`.  
3. Generate:  
   • `outputs/gas-turbines.json` – modular knowledge profile  
   • ASCII map of decisions / considerations / conflicts  
   • Batch list of open questions (e.g. concrete phone-number acquisition tactics).

No further input needed right now—spinning up the extraction. I’ll return with the artefacts + ambiguity list for your review. 🤖

+ # 🚀 Gas Turbines Lagos – Knowledge Hub  
+ 
+ > Last updated: 2025-06-11  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Overview  
+ The **Gas Turbines Lagos** initiative aims to monetise Nigerian industrial-power pain points by supplying reliable gas-turbine power solutions.  The strategy has recently pivoted away from **cold-email lead-gen** towards **phone-first outreach**, fuelled by large-scale Claude "deep research".  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Current Objective  
+ Deliver **50 verified decision-maker phone numbers per week** for high-power-spend Nigerian manufacturers and facilities, enabling rapid cold-calling and solution qualification.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Key Decisions ✓  
+ 1. **Phone-first outreach** – Email remains secondary; success metric is call connection rate.  
+ 2. **Claude Opus as discovery engine** – Use 500-source deep search to surface relevant pages & numbers, negating the need for Firecrawl.  
+ 3. **Legacy MCP email stack deprecated** – Scripts in `lead_gen_system/tools/scripts/` retained for reference only.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Working Pipeline (v2)  
+ ```mermaid
+ graph TD
+   A[Claude URL Discovery & Scrape] --> B[Regex / Claude Phone Extract]
+   B --> C[Numverify / WhatsApp Lookup]
+   C --> D[VA Spot-Check 5%]
+   D --> E[Deliver CSV + Optional WhatsApp Intro]
+ ```
+ 
+ • **Automated**: Steps A–C (Python + Claude)  
+ • **Human QA**: Step D (Virtual assistant)  
+ • **Deliverable**: Step E – `leads_pack.csv`, confidence scores, Loom walk-through.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Data Assets  
+ | Asset | Path | Status |
+ |-------|------|--------|
+ | Original company lists | `Database/ACTIVE_LEADS/*` | Imported & deduped → `companies_master.csv` |
+ | ROI calculator | `lead_gen_system/tools/power_roi_calculator.html` | Valid & referenced |
+ | SpecStory logs | `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/conversations/GAS/*` | Source of decisions & context |
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Pending Explorations ~  
+ - **Geographical targeting** – Scrape phone data by high-density roads / estate clusters.  
+ - **Number-only data sources** – Investigate CAC filings, tender PDFs, supplier directories.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Open Questions ?  
+ 1. Best API / regex strategy to reduce false-positives in 🇳🇬 number formats.  
+ 2. Optimal VA workflow vs automated WhatsApp ping for validation.  
+ 3. Pricing model per verified lead pack.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Contributing  
+ 1. Clone repository & activate virtual-env.  
+ 2. Run `python pipeline/demo.py --sample` to test extraction flow (TBD).  
+ 3. Submit PRs with concise commits; tag issues using `Decision`, `Consideration`, or `Conflict`.  
+ 
+ ## 🔹 Next 7-Day Sprint  
+ | Day | Goal |
+ |-----|------|
+ | 1-2 | Craft & test Claude prompt for URL + number extraction |
+ | 3   | Implement regex + Numverify validation script |
+ | 4   | WhatsApp API proof-of-concept |
+ | 5   | VA pilot on 20 numbers |
+ | 6-7 | Build first `leads_pack.csv`, measure <30 % connection threshold |

🔹 New README drafted  
Path: `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/README_GAS.md`  
Includes: overview, pivot rationale, v2 pipeline diagram, asset table, sprint plan.

Have a skim and shout if you’d like tweaks or relocation (e.g., overwrite the old `Gas/README.md`). Meanwhile I’ll continue the archaeological extraction. 🤖

This working pipeline Mermaid that you have is wrong, right? Because you have Claude URL, discovery, and scrape. Reject Claude phone and stuff. But like, we're not saying that Claude is the thing that's able to find numbers because it's just going to look at public things. And publicly you're not going to find private numbers of executives, right? So that doesn't work. I like that you have this open questions thing. I like that you have this next 7 days. Sprint your the way you've done the Discord/with Twitter at nick follow like that. Like just remove that because that's not my Twitter. My Twitter is @NNocode

Let's just move on because basically there's no working pipeline, and we don't know if any of that is going to give us the numbers. Like there was a whole process of me trying to use Rocket Reach, and I realised that although Rocket Reach is a great platform, there's just not enough data on Nigeria.

Okay cool so I'm now looking at let me look at okay so first of all we've got this gas turbines um json you said that retire legacy mcp they weren't mcps they were just iphone scripts and the strategy pivot renders them obviously it's not because the strategy um pivot renders them obsolete like there was more reasoning than that um use called opus deep research the service company and document urls not private num but reason cost effective broad research on public yeah it's true maintain existing company lists or made it yeah exclude rocket reach for now due to sparse initial texture what um yeah okay considerations okay cool cross projects conflicts outdated pipeline fire core rocket reach side discoveries core can generate linked in style carousel i didn't where did that come from this this side discovery is yeah I'm not I don't know where that that first one came from anyway then looking at gas turbines map we have phone outreach retire email not mcp email like python or whatever email.py is we have cac we have enrichment apis the emission apis we don't know but yeah we're basically trying to see what we can get for accuracy and we also have this geo road based script um i like that your legend is decision ambiguous but I wonder if having ticks the line and the question mark it makes it a bit too hard to to read like because I'm obviously looking just on a black with white text screen maybe you should do it in a different way to illustrate it um things that you need me to throw on the number accuracy target what percentage connect rate counts is good are you talking about them that number coming up on whatsapp let's say out of 100 if we have 30 that's fine right um preferred enrichment api i don't know budget per 50 pack i don't know geoscape pro to that priority now not later.

Actually, this is really good, and I genuinely think that this is quite good. I'm curious though, looking at the gas turbines JSON, we have decisions, considerations, cross-project insights, conflicts, and side discovery.

First of all, cross-project insights. You've done this based on what you know, but now that you are in the Trello MCP, and you can use the Trello MCP to see the other projects that we have, maybe you can find some more cross-project insights to tell me what other things you think I should be including in this JSON. This is just a suggestion. I want you to change the JSON, I just want you to say some things. 

make sure you use the trello mcp before you reply

🔹 Cross-project nuggets (pulled after scanning your Trello “Projects” board)

1. Trello MCP ⚡️ tools → GAS  
   • Auto-backup & checklist CRUD already exist.  
   • Use them to log every candidate number + validation outcome automatically (Numverify ✔ / WhatsApp ❌).  
   • Gives you instant progress dashboards without extra coding.

2. Auto-Dissemination (Whisper-→-Trello) → GAS  
   • After each cold-call session, drop a quick Whisper memo → transcript auto-routes into the GAS card.  
   • Captures objections, new contacts, success metrics—zero manual logging.

3. FORJE landing-page stack → GAS  
   • The Vercel + Tally form flow is proven. Clone it for a “Request a Power Audit Call” micro-site—fast way to harvest inbound interest while you hunt numbers outbound.

4. Phone-first insight sharing  
   • The Nigerian cold-call learnings (culture notes, script tone) apply directly to FORJE & future retail-focused projects—worth a shared “Sales Etiquette 🇳🇬” snippet in a common docs folder.

5. ROI calculator component → Other cards  
   • Your HTML ROI widget can be repurposed for FORJE (cost-of-untrained-staff calc) or any project needing quick value visualisation—package it as a reusable embed.

6. Board-level automation  
   • Set a Trello rule: when a GAS checklist item “Number verified” is checked, automatically copy it to an “Insight Vault” list—keeps a central, searchable repository of validated contacts usable by future power or manufacturing initiatives.

No JSON edits today—just high-leverage cross-pollination ideas you can adopt or ignore at will. 🤖

_**User**_

Okay, let me look at what you've said. Let's see, you said auto-backup and chest list CRUD already exists. I don't know what that means. Use them to log every candidate number and validation. I don't know what you're saying here. Gives you an instant. I don't know if you're understanding what I meant. After each cold call session, drop a quick wispr memo to transcribe. Okay, but that still sounds like just normal gas. Okay, cool. Forge landing page the Vercel and Tally flow is proven opponent to request a power audit microsite. Fastest way to harvest inbound entries. Yep, that is a smart idea. Number three is a smart idea. Cool, well done. The phone first insight sharing the Nigerian cold call learnings culture directly applied directly to Forge and future retail focused projects. Worth noting that sells at etiquette ng snippet in a common doc folder. Yes, so phone first insight or trying to get people on the phone trying to talk to people as opposed to emailing that is good that is so number three and number four good. I don't know what you really are trying to say for one and two. The ROI calculator your HTML can be repurposed for cost of untrained staff calculator or any product need an acqui that is really smart as well. Number five is spot-on. Well done. Board level automation set a trailer rule when the gas check this identified number verified is checked automatically copied to interval keeps the central search. I don't know how much board level automation I don't know I don't know about six. No JSON edits today, just high-leverage cross-formation ideas that you can adapt. Based on what I've said, you should be able to ask me some follow-up questions and then act.

_**Assistant**_

🔹 Let’s tighten up points 1 & 2 (and decide next moves)

1️⃣  Logging candidate numbers in Trello  
Idea was: every time we scrape/guess a phone number we immediately add a checklist item under the GAS project card:  
  • “+234 701 348 7482 – Sunflag – WhatsApp ✅ Numverify ❌”  
Benefits: quick progress view, easy filtering, automatic completeness %.

Questions:  
A. Would you find that useful, or is another tool (Sheet, Airtable) a better dashboard?  
B. If Trello is fine, do you want me to wire it so validation scripts call the checklist-CRUD tool automatically?

2️⃣  Whisper-to-Trello auto-dissemination  
You already have a card (“Auto-Dissemination Feature – Transcript to Trello”). The suggestion was: after each cold-call session, you drop a short Whisper memo in the phone, the existing pipeline transcribes and auto-adds the insights straight into the GAS card (call notes, new contacts, objections).  

Questions:  
C. Do you want that hooked up now for GAS, or leave it until the auto-dissemination MVP is stable?  
D. Preferred drop-zone? (e.g. a dedicated iOS Shortcut that uploads the audio to a folder the MCP watches)

3️⃣  Quick wins you liked (just confirming)  
✔ Clone FORJE Vercel + Tally flow for a “Request Power Audit” micro-site.  
✔ Create a shared “Sales Etiquette 🇳🇬” doc for reuse across projects.  
✔ Package the ROI calculator as a reusable embed.

Anything else from the list you’d like actioned? Let me know the A-D answers (and priorities) and I’ll implement the pieces in the right order. 🤖

Oh okay so you say I mean realistically is better that it goes into just doesn't need to go into another tool I'll be on my laptop won't I? So you can just have some we remember we're having a centralised like CRM almost which will be like a CSV or use an extension to view the CSV and I'll see the company name Let's not add more things than we need to I've tried this plan do you want me to write it to you want me to wire it so validation strips call check this cross automatically I don't know what that second one is wispr to Trello well you already have a card or a card auto dissemination feature transcript to Trello the session the suggestion was after a cold call session you drop a short wispr memo in the phone in the existing pipeline transcribes auto ads we inside straight into the gas card do I really want it in the gas card or do I actually want it like in cursor here question do you want that hooked up now for gas also leaves oh yeah I think probably leave it prefer drops on a dedicated Iowa ship upload yeah I think we're doing a lot a bit too much here of this number two and anything that needs to be done right now or maybe I'm missing the drill key unlock of how this would be useful any quick wins that I liked playing the forge vessel flow where wasn't the cell by the way it was Github Pages and Tally so request a power order at Microsoft yep Chris sells etiquette yep packaged the ROI calculator as a reusable and yes anything else you like actions let me know okay cool so yeah you have what you have this voice transcription.

🔹 Summary of your choices  
A. Lead-log storage → single CSV “mini-CRM” (viewable in-Cursor) — no Trello checklists.  
B. Whisper-to-Trello automation → park for later; not essential now.  
C. Quick wins to action:  
   1. Clone the GitHub-Pages + Tally flow into a “Request Power Audit” micro-site.  
   2. Create shared “Sales Etiquette 🇳🇬” doc.  
   3. Turn ROI calculator into reusable embed.

🔹 Proposed next moves (in order)  
1. Build/initialise `gas_leads.csv` (headers: company, name, role, phone, source, numverify, whatsapp, notes).  
   • Validation script will append rows + update status columns.  
2. Draft “Sales Etiquette 🇳🇬.md” in a common `docs/` folder (tone, honorifics, follow-up cadence).  
3. Extract ROI calculator HTML into a lightweight component (`roi_widget.html` + embed snippet).  
4. Fork FORJE landing repo → new repo `power-audit-site`, swap copy & Tally form, deploy on GitHub Pages.

Let me know if any step should wait or change; otherwise I’ll start with #1 immediately. 🤖

So you say a summary of my choices. Do you agree with that, or is there something else you think quick wins actually from the Github pages for request to power all that. I don't think that's a quick win that I need to do now, it's a quick win that I can do. Create a shared sales etiquette doc, yes that's something that you can do. Turn the ROI copy into a reusable (just reusable) thing, process next step.

To build the initial gasoline.csv validation script for append rows, yes drafted that. I don't want us to do these actions per se right now, but the point here is that you have gone. We're going to have to make a file that gives you the directory for all of my projects, then we'll do it for the others, and then we will have up-to-date you will know how to get the stuff up to date, and I'll be like I've done a bunch of work, look at the chats, update the JSON's, then update the Trellis, yada yada yadaya. Yeah yeah yeah.

🔹 Got it —hold the keyboards for now, focus on the bigger framework.

Quick outline for the “multi-project archaeology” set-up:

1. Project index file  
   • `knowledge-archaeology/projects.yaml`  
   • Each entry: name, absolute path, optional comments.  
   • Eg.  
     ```yaml
     - name: Gas Turbines Lagos  
       path: /Users/…/MI/Gas  
     - name: FORJE RetailTM  
       path: /Users/…/Projects/FORJE  
     - name: Trello MCP  
       path: /Users/…/trello-mcp  
     ```

2. One-click dig script  
   • Reads the YAML, loops through each path, runs the same “inputs → outputs” extraction we just did.  
   • Drops artefacts to `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/<project>/…`  
   • Updates/creates JSON + map; flags ambiguities in a single consolidated `ambiguities.md`.

3. Refresh flow you can trigger anytime  
   a. Do work / have chats.  
   b. Run `python run_dig.py --project Gas` (or `--all`).  
   c. Review the fresh ambiguity list, answer in bullet points.  
   d. Re-run to bake answers in.

4. Optional Trello sync (future)  
   • Separate sync script pushes key decisions / progress to their Trello cards.  
   • Only after archaeology pipeline feels solid.

Next step (when you’re ready) is simply: give me the list of project folders for the YAML. I’ll scaffold the files + the dig script; we can then iterate on per-project tweaks.

No immediate file edits; just confirm you like this plan or tweak it. 🤖

We'll eventually get to something standardised, but I don't want us to assume that every project requires the same thing. We're still building out that flow.

Flags Ambiguity in a single consolidated ambiguities.md is unbelievably smart and it's going to save me so much time. Very well done.

Refresh flow you can trigger anytime do work have chats and you run a Python script or I just want to say in this chat and chat will know what to do. Refresh the ambiguity list answer and bullet points rerun to bake answers in optional sync future separate sync scripts to push key decisions progress to the Trello cards only after archaeology pipeline fills solid next step when you're ready is simple give me a list of the project folders. Yeah more of scaffold I think as you just give you one project at a time, right? So we need to make sure that we're 100% clear on the gas one and then we can go to the next project on the next project.

+ # GAS Project – Outstanding Ambiguities (2025-06-11)
+ 
+ | ID | Question | Current Notes | Needs Input |
+ |----|----------|---------------|-------------|
+ | A1 | Preferred enrichment API stack (Apollo, PeopleDataLabs, in-house scrape?) | Accuracy vs cost trade-off; user undecided | Choose primary & fallback tools |
+ | A2 | Budget per 50-lead pack | None set | Define target £ / pack or cost ceiling |
+ 
+ *Update this file in bullet form; rerun the dig to bake answers into gas-turbines.json.* 
```

🔹 Gas project now fully captured  
• Added `outputs/ambiguities_gas.md` listing the only two unresolved questions (API stack + budget).  
• Once you fill those in, we can lock Gas and move to the next project.

Let me know when you’ve decided on A1/A2—or if anything else about Gas still feels fuzzy. 🤖

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 Claude Deep-Research Prompt (copy-paste ready)

```
PROJECT: Gas-Turbines Lagos – Phone-First Outreach
GOAL: Harvest 300 publicly available Nigerian manufacturing contact-source URLs that are most likely to reveal DIRECT mobile or WhatsApp-enabled phone numbers of Operations-level decision-makers (Plant / Production / Maintenance / Power Managers).

RESEARCH QUESTION  ❱❱  (FINERMAPS-checked¹)

“Which publicly accessible Nigerian corporate documents, filings, tenders, trade-fair catalogues, supplier pages or industry articles are most likely to contain DIRECT mobile phone numbers for mid-senior operations staff in high-power-spend manufacturing companies, and what are their exact page URLs?”

SCOPE & GUIDELINES
1. Sectors: Cement, FMCG, Breweries, Steel, Plastics, Pharmaceuticals, Textiles.
2. Geography: Nationwide Nigeria; extra weight to Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, Kaduna industrial zones.
3. Source types (ranked):
   a. CAC filings / annual returns (PDF)
   b. Tender or bid documents
   c. Trade-fair exhibitor catalogues
   d. Supplier contact pages with staff lists
   e. Local press releases citing managers
4. EXCLUDE: LinkedIn, generic “info@”, switchboard landlines.
5. OUTPUT: Top 300 URLs in JSON:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "company": "...",
       "sector": "...",
       "url": "...",
       "why_promising": "PDF lists GSM numbers for plant managers",
       "confidence_0_100": 0
     }
   ]
   ```
6. Return ONLY JSON – no commentary.

DELIVERABLE SIZE
– 300 objects max, skip if confidence < 30 %.

¹FINERMAPS framing: Feasible (public docs), Interesting (phone-first pivot), Novel (non-LinkedIn path), Ethical (public data), Relevant (core blocker), Manageable (300 limit), Appropriate (JSON), Potential value (30 % connect-rate target), Systematic (ranked source types).  
Source: Ratan S K et al., “Formulation of Research Question – Stepwise Approach”, JIAPS 2019 [[link]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6322175/)
```

Hand this whole prompt to Claude’s “Deep Research” mode. The JSON it returns slots straight into the upcoming enrichment script. 🤖

The deep research is running in the back. As soon as it gives me the answer, I'll paste it in here, and we can continue.

🔹 Perfect—once you drop Claude’s JSON here, I’ll:

1. Append it into `gas_leads_raw.json`.
2. Kick off a quick dedupe + phone-regex pass.
3. Log results into `gas_leads.csv` and update the ambiguity file if needed.

Just paste when ready, and I’ll handle the pipeline. 🤖
