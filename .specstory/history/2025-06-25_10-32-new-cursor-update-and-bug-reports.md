You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 What’s new in the latest Cursor releases  
• Version 1.1 (12 Jun 2025) – “Background Agents in Slack”  
  – Mention @Cursor in any Slack thread to spin-up a Background Agent that reads the thread, runs tasks remotely, and opens PRs.  
  – Progress notifications from MCP servers, dynamic tool registration, “roots” support.  
  – Settings search (⌘/Ctrl + F) and a clutch of performance patches (1.1.1 – 1.1.6).  
• Version 1.0 (04 Jun 2025) – “BugBot & Memories”  
  – BugBot: automatic PR review; click “Fix in Cursor” to jump back to the editor.  
  – Background Agent now GA for everyone (⌘/Ctrl + E).  
  – Memories (beta): per-project knowledge that the agent can recall.  
  – One-click MCP install + OAuth; curated marketplace of official servers.  
  – Agent edits Jupyter notebooks (Claude Sonnet only for now).  
  – Rich Chat rendering: Mermaid diagrams, Markdown tables, inline visuals.  
  – New dashboard with usage analytics, plus pricing simplification & Max-mode tweaks.  

🔹 Rapid-fire patches you might have missed  
• 1.0.1 – stability fixes for Background Agent.  
• 0.50.x – seven hot-patches addressing search-&-replace reliability, Windows scrolling bug, indexing, checkpointing, etc.  

🔹 Bugs & pain-points users are reporting on the forum  
1. Random freezing/hanging in 0.48 → 1.0 when projects have 1 000 + files or large binaries; correlated with the new indexer and Git operations. Partial workaround: slim down the repo or revert to 0.47.9.  
2. UI completely greyed-out / frozen on macOS after the 1.0 update; reinstall sometimes helps, but several users switched back temporarily.  
3. Ubuntu-specific UI glitches introduced in 1.0 (menus disappearing, layout breakage).  
4. Playwright MCP server no longer launches a browser post-update; suspected change in how MCP processes spawn.  
5. “Check for updates” falsely says “no update”, forcing manual download of the 1.0 DMG.  
6. Memory feature hidden if Privacy Mode is on – confusion over the requirement.  
7. Warning that Gemini 2.5 Pro is “not recommended” for Background Agents may be stale – users asking for clarification.  

Quick mitigations floating around the threads:  
• Create a new chat + restart Cursor to get ~30 min of stability when freezes begin.  
• Add heavy folders to `.cursorignore` (or use new “Global ignore” in settings) to lighten indexing.  
• Disable GPU acceleration (`--disable-gpu`) for some Linux UI issues.
