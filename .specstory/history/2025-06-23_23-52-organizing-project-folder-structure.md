# Organizing project folder structure (2025-06-24 00:52:41)

_**User**_

All of the projects are in the projects folder, so that is the gas solutions basically Hibiscus ones all need to be just one Hibiscus and not three. Then you have Retail, then we also have now Delphi, and we also have Nigerian Budget Research to my knowledge. And then I guess we also have Fitness. Do I have a preferred top-level for the structure? If you could show me three, and then I can pick from there. Should be archived to the old move the older archive in active like legacy chest. I mean you can remove them, but suggest how you're going to move them. Where would you like this Stream of Thought document stored? What would be called? I think it should be just called Stream of Thought and it should probably be in the parent folder.

Is the MTB task system also still the single source of truth? No, it isn't anymore. Um really I want the single source of truth to be yes we need to decide what makes sense of where it should go.

So what I really want is that we have this as the parent folder, then all of this stuff that I've now opened in separate Finder cursor windows as projects are just folders within this parent folder that make more sense. Any size limits? No. How should we prioritise by earliest deadline and revenue potential or something else? Yeah, it's probably earliest deadline and revenue potential, and then also how much effort I'm getting putting into each one by logs and stuff that you know we're getting that this is good.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

You are a senior prompt engineer who turns messy questions into super-clear instructions for AI. Your job is to:

- Make questions crystal clear and specific
- Break big ideas into smaller, manageable pieces
- Make sure answers are practical and usable
- Think about who's asking and what they need
- Keep making the questions better and better

THE 3-STEP PROCESS

1.  BREAKING THINGS DOWN
- Figure out what someone really wants to know
- Take big, confusing ideas and make them smaller
- Strip away anything that's not really needed

2.  BUILDING THE PERFECT QUESTION
- Tell the AI exactly what job to do
- Give clear instructions about how answers should look
- Choose what kind of expert the AI should pretend to be
- Check if the question can be made even better

3.  MAKING SURE IT WORKS
- Would this question get good answers every time?
- Could someone misunderstand this question?
- Does this fit what the person is trying to learn?

EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS

Example 1: Bad Question → Good Question
Bad: "How do I market my business?"
Good: "You're a marketing expert. Give me 3 marketing strategies that:
- Cost under $1,000
- Have worked for real businesses
- Can be started this week
Include exact steps and common mistakes."

Example 2: Bad Question → Good Question
Bad: "How can I be more productive?"
Good: "You're a productivity coach. Give me a 7-day plan that:
- Improves how I use time
- Manages my energy
- Helps me focus better
Include real examples and ways to measure success."

Example 3: Bad Question → Good Question
Bad: "Explain AI safety"
Good: "You're an AI expert. Explain AI safety like you're talking to a regular person. Break it down into:
- What could go wrong
- How we can prevent problems
- Real examples of AI safety issues
Include solutions and their pros/cons."

TEMPLATE FOR MAKING PERFECT QUESTIONS

Always structure questions like this:
"You are [type of expert]. Using simple terms, explain [topic]. Break it into [number] main parts. Give [specific examples or steps]. Make your answer [format type]. Think about [important factors]. Your answer should help [target audience] and show success by [how to measure it]."

IMPORTANT RULES
- Don't use complicated words unless needed
- Make sure questions can't be misunderstood
- Adjust questions based on who's asking
- Make sure answers will be actually useful

YOUR MAIN JOB
Turn any question into the clearest, most useful version possible. Make sure every question leads to answers that people can actually use in real life.

Remember: Your goal is to turn confusing questions into super-clear ones that get amazing answers from AI!


THE PROMPT: "
You're a world-class project manager and systems architect. Your task is to reorganize a cluttered digital workspace for a creative entrepreneur. The goal is to create a structure that is "simply genius"—intuitive, scalable, and easy to maintain.

You need to propose three distinct organizational structures for their `projects` folder.

**Background:**
- The user is a non-technical product designer with an interest in building online businesses.
- They value 80/20 solutions and concise, brilliant ideas.
- Key projects: Gas Solutions, Hibiscus Studio (needs consolidation), Retail, Delphi, Nigerian Budget Research, Fitness.
- Prioritization factors: earliest deadline, revenue potential, and logged effort.
- The previous task management system is obsolete; a new "single source of truth" is needed.
- They want a `Stream of Thought.md` file at the root of the workspace.

**Your Task:**
1.  **Analyze the current project folder structure.**
2.  **Propose three distinct organizational structures.** For each structure, provide:
    *   A clear name and philosophy (e.g., "The Agency Model," "The Venture Studio Model").
    *   A visual representation of the folder structure.
    *   A description of how it handles active projects, archives, and the new "single source of truth."
    *   The pros and cons of the approach, tailored to the user's profile.
3.  **Recommend a plan for archiving old files.**
4.  **Await the user's decision before taking any action.**

**Formatting:**
- Use bold headings with "🔹 " at the start.
- Use bullet points for clarity and conciseness.
- Write in British English.
- Be direct, anticipate needs, and provide actionable solutions.
- End your response with "🤖".

Okay, let's get this sorted. First, I'll examine the current state of your `projects` directory to understand what we're working with.

Right, I've had a look at the `projects` directory. It's a classic case of organic growth—functional, but ready for a "simply genius" refactor.

Here are three distinct structures for you to consider. Each one tackles project organisation and your "single source of truth" problem in a different way.

***

### 🔹 Option 1: The Venture Studio

This model treats each project as a standalone business venture. It's clean, scalable, and great for maintaining focus on individual project goals.

*   **Philosophy:** Each project is an independent entity. The structure separates projects by their lifecycle stage: active, incubation, and research.
*   **Structure:**
    ```
    trello-mcp/
    ├── Stream of Thought.md
    └── projects/
        ├── 1_Active_Ventures/
        │   ├── Hibiscus_Studio/
        │   └── Retail/
        ├── 2_Incubating_Ventures/
        │   ├── Delphi/
        │   └── Fitness/
        ├── 3_Research_Initiatives/
        │   └── Nigerian_Budget_Research/
        └── _Archive/
            ├── Gas_Solutions/
            └── ... (old projects here)
    ```
*   **Single Source of Truth:** A `README.md` file inside *each* project folder. It would act as a mini-dashboard with a consistent template:
    *   **Status:** (e.g., Active, Paused)
    *   **Priority:** (High, Medium, Low)
    *   **Next Deadline:**
    *   **Revenue Potential:** (£££, ££, £)
    *   **Key Links:** (Figma, GitHub, etc.)
*   **Pros:**
    *   Extremely clean and focused.
    *   Forces you to think about each project's specific stage and goals.
    *   Scales well as you add more ventures.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires discipline to keep each `README.md` updated.
    *   Might feel a bit rigid if projects frequently jump between stages.

***

### 🔹 Option 2: The Thematic Hub

This model groups projects by their nature or context. It's ideal if you think in terms of "what hat am I wearing now?"—client work, personal brand, or pure exploration.

*   **Philosophy:** Organise by the *type* of work, not just its status. This aligns projects with your different roles or business lines.
*   **Structure:**
    ```
    trello-mcp/
    ├── Stream of Thought.md
    └── projects/
        ├── 1_Client_Work/
        │   └── Gas_Solutions/
        ├── 2_Personal_Ventures/
        │   ├── Hibiscus_Studio/
        │   └── Retail/
        ├── 3_Explorations/
        │   ├── Delphi/
        │   ├── Fitness/
        │   └── Nigerian_Budget_Research/
        └── _Archive/
            └── ... (old projects here)
    ```
*   **Single Source of Truth:** A single, master `DASHBOARD.md` file in the `projects/` directory. This file would provide a high-level overview of everything, with links to each project folder.
    *   **Example Entry:** `*   **Hibiscus Studio** - *In Progress* - [View Project](mdc:projects/2_Personal_Ventures/Hibiscus_Studio)`
*   **Pros:**
    *   Great for context-switching.
    *   The central dashboard gives you a "mission control" view of everything at a glance.
    *   Flexible enough to add new categories later (e.g., `4_Joint_Ventures`).
*   **Cons:**
    *   The central dashboard could become a bottleneck to update.
    *   Less clarity on the *stage* of a project without clicking into it.

***

### 🔹 Option 3: The Kanban Flow

This model turns your folder structure into a live Kanban board. It’s highly visual and process-oriented, perfect for tracking a project's journey from idea to completion.

*   **Philosophy:** A project's location *is* its status. You physically move folders from one stage to the next.
*   **Structure:**
    ```
    trello-mcp/
    ├── Stream of Thought.md
    └── projects/
        ├── 1_Ideation/
        │   ├── Delphi/
        │   └── Fitness/
        ├── 2_In_Progress/
        │   ├── Hibiscus_Studio/
        │   └── Retail/
        ├── 3_Client_Delivery/
        │   └── Gas_Solutions/
        ├── 4_Completed/
        │   └── Nigerian_Budget_Research/
        └── 5_Archive/
            └── ... (old projects here)
    ```
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The folder structure itself provides the high-level status. For detailed metadata, each project folder would contain a `_meta.json` file. This is more for me (the AI) to manage and could be used to generate reports automatically.
*   **Pros:**
    *   The most intuitive way to see your project pipeline at a glance.
    *   Moving a folder feels like a satisfying, tangible action.
    *   Lends itself well to automation (e.g., I could generate a weekly progress report based on folder locations).
*   **Cons:**
    *   The most rigid structure; projects must fit into a linear flow.
    *   Metadata is less human-readable (`.json` vs `.md`).

***

### 🔹 Archiving Plan

For any option you choose, I will:
1.  Create the `_Archive/` (or `5_Archive/`) folder.
2.  Move the following legacy/inactive folders into it: `hibiscus-studio-pages`, `hibiscus-studio-consolidated`, `forje-certification`, `by hand`, and `Chats`.
3.  Consolidate all relevant `hibiscus-studio` assets into the single new `Hibiscus_Studio` folder.
4.  Move `retailtm-landing` into the new `Retail` folder.

Let me know which structure resonates most with your thinking. Once you decide, I'll execute the reorganisation.
