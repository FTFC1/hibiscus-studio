You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Right, let's build this transcript extraction tool properly**

Looking at your specification, this is genuinely brilliant - a systematic approach to turn messy transcripts into actionable blueprints. I'll create a proper implementation that follows your exact formatting rules and extraction logic.
