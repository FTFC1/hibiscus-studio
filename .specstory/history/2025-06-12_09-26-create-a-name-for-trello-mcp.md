You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀. 

🔹 Scan complete – Trello MCP  
I’ve mirrored the Retail-style knowledge archaeology for this repo.

1. JSON profile (grouped by code, docs, config, etc.) – [trello_mcp_profile.json](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_profile.json)  
2. Starter ambiguity list – [trello_mcp_ambiguities.md](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_ambiguities.md)  
3. Compact 3-level directory map – [trello_mcp_knowledge_map.txt](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_knowledge_map.txt)

Feel free to skim those and let me know:

• Anything unclear that should jump straight into the ambiguity list?  
• Extra buckets or tagging you’d like in the JSON profile?  

Next steps could be auto-tagging critical files, generating a task list from the ambiguities, or wiring this into a regular CI report – just shout. 🤖

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀. 

🔹 Output set refreshed & aligned  
I mirrored the naming/structure used by GAS & Retail:

• README – [README_TRELLO_MCP.md](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/README_TRELLO_MCP.md)  
• Profile JSON (underscore) – [trello_mcp_profile.json](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_profile.json)  
• Profile JSON (hyphen) – [trello-mcp.json](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello-mcp.json)  
• Concept summary – [trello_mcp_profile_concept.json](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_profile_concept.json)  
• Map (hyphen) – [trello-mcp-map.txt](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello-mcp-map.txt)  
• Ambiguities – [trello_mcp_ambiguities.md](mdc:knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/trello_mcp_ambiguities.md)

The old `trello_mcp_knowledge_map.txt` remains (identical content) for safety, but we can delete it once you’re happy.

Let me know if any headings, sections, or file naming tweaks are still off, and I’ll tighten it further. 🤖

_**User**_

i think you need to run the trello mcp to see the lists too to understand ( not about the projects but the tools we have )

Also delete the old files we only need readme. ambigutites, json

---

remove old map file

---

remove duplicate map file

keep single json file (hyphen)

_**User**_

Can you add some suggestion automation pipeline workflows. But first clarify you understand the most recent goals 

---

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀. 

🔹 Clarifying Most Recent Goals (Trello MCP context)

Here’s my understanding of your current goals for the Trello MCP project, based on our recent actions and the cleaned-up outputs:

**1. Knowledge Hub Alignment**
- Mirror the structure and clarity of the Retail and GAS project knowledge outputs.
- Keep only the essential files: README, ambiguities, and a single JSON profile (plus concept summary).
- Ensure outputs are concise, actionable, and easy for a non-technical product designer to skim.

**2. Automation Focus**
- The main value of Trello MCP is exposing powerful Trello automations (backups, label processing, checklist utilities, Gmail/Trello bridges) via a unified MCP server interface.
- The goal is to stabilise and productionise these automations, especially:
  - Nightly Trello board backups (JSON dumps)
  - WAFFLE label archival flows (auto-archiving cards with specific labels)
  - Checklist and card utilities
  - (Optionally) Gmail/Trello integration for notifications or triggers

**3. Workflow & Tooling**
- Make it easy to see what automations exist, what’s in progress, and what’s next (hence the board lists and cleaned outputs).
- Reduce ambiguity about what each tool does, how it’s triggered, and what the success metrics are.
- Prepare for further automation/CI integration and regular reporting.

**4. Simplicity & Clarity**
- Avoid unnecessary complexity—prefer “simply genius” solutions.
- Outputs and automations should be easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

**If any of these are off, correct me!**  
Otherwise, I’ll suggest some automation pipeline workflows that fit these goals—focusing on practical, testable, and easy-to-extend flows.

Ready for pipeline suggestions, or is there anything to clarify/tweak first? 🤖

---

_**User**_

So it doesn't mirror the clarity. Yes, it mirrors the clarity, but it obviously has checklists and it's a bit more detailed than the knowledge outputs. But it does keep the essential files in its attachments as well so that I can look at those on the go. The main value is exposing powerful Trello automations, backups, stable processing, utility bridges where are you. Yes that is how what apparently the goal is to save words and productize these automations like these Trello backups. I mean yes it automation but I think we need to update it because you've done so much more now. I think this concept that you have of the automation focus is probably like a month old. It's now June 13th, 2025, I think we probably came out with this the last month. Work with me to make it easy to see what automations exist, what's in progress. I mean not just the automations, what projects I have in progress which is ambiguous about what each tool does, how it's triggered, and success management. I'm not sure you mean in relation to what my projects or this specific MTP? Avoid unnecessary complexity, simply genes yet are any of these off? Okay, well you've heard what I've just said now, so go off of that. 

---

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀. 

🔹 Updated Understanding (June 2025, Trello MCP context)

Here’s my revised take, based on your latest:

**1. More Than Just Automations**
- The project isn’t just about automations—it's about surfacing what’s in progress, what’s available, and what’s next, across both automations and broader projects.
- You want a single, mobile-friendly hub that:
  - Shows all key automations (what, how, status, triggers, outputs)
  - Surfaces all active projects (not just scripts/tools, but actual workstreams)
  - Links to essential files/attachments for on-the-go review

**2. Clarity & Attachments**
- The hub should make it dead simple to:
  - See what automations exist, what they do, and how to use/trigger them
  - See which projects are in progress, their status, and next steps
  - Access the most important files (JSON, README, ambiguities, etc.) directly from the hub

**3. Success = Visibility + Usability**
- Success is not just “it works” but “I can see, use, and share it easily”
- Each automation/project should have:
  - A clear description (what/why)
  - Status (in progress, stable, needs review, etc.)
  - Trigger method (manual, scheduled, webhook, etc.)
  - Output/attachment links (so you can check results on mobile)
  - Success metric (how do we know it’s working?)

**4. Simplicity, but Not Oversimplified**
- Still want “simply genius” solutions, but not at the expense of hiding useful detail (e.g., checklists, attachments, status tags)
- The hub should be concise but not cryptic—enough info to act, not just a pretty list

**5. This Applies to Trello MCP, But Also Sets a Pattern**
- The same approach should work for other projects (Retail, GAS, etc.)—a unified, actionable, mobile-friendly “project/automation hub” for all your work

---

🔹 Next Steps

**1. Suggest Automation/Project Hub Structure**
- I’ll propose a new structure for the README (or a new “hub” file) that:
  - Lists all automations/tools with status, trigger, output, and attachment links
  - Lists all active projects/workstreams with status and next steps
  - Surfaces key files for each (JSON, ambiguities, etc.)
  - Is easy to update as things change

**2. Suggest Example Automation Pipeline Workflows**
- For each automation, I’ll show:
  - What it does
  - How it’s triggered
  - What outputs/attachments it creates
  - How you check if it worked (success metric)
  - Where to find/check results

**3. (Optional) Script/Template to Auto-Generate This Hub**
- If you want, I can make a script that auto-generates this hub from your current automations/projects, so it’s always up to date

---

**Before I draft the new structure:**
- Do you want this as a new file (e.g., PROJECT_HUB.md) or as a replacement for README?
- Should it include only automations, or all projects (even non-automation ones)?
- Any specific fields/tags you want for each automation/project (e.g., owner, last run, etc.)?

Let me know, and I’ll build the new structure + sample workflows. 🤖

_**User**_

tool just to remind yourself this applies to Trello but also PayPal. Same approach to our project so unified as before. Okay maybe you do understand that I'm not following. I propose a new structure for the readme or for a new hub file that lists all the automations we've started showing, suggest example formation and show what it does this is this for if I drop a new strategy do you want do you want this as a new file project or as a I think this hub telling me what automation exists is probably just one list in the board and the other things are actually the projects. Success equals visibility plus usability. So it's not just it works but I can see, use and share easily. Use automation project, should have a clear description of why status in progress, stable needs review. I mean I think you need to look at the MCP again as in like my actual board using the MCP I'm a project hub. I'm the other person read me should include any automations or all projects even non-automation ones You can show me both types. I can compare any specific for sides You can impress me you can do exactly anything that you want to impress me

- > Last updated: 2025-06-12
+ > Last updated: 2025-06-13
  
  ## 🔹 Overview
- The **Trello MCP** project provides a set of server-side tools (Python + JS) that expose powerful Trello automations through the **MCP tool interface**.  Capabilities include board backups, label processors (WAFFLE → WAFFLE ARCHIVED), checklist utilities and Gmail/Trello bridge scripts.
+ The **Trello MCP** project provides a unified interface for managing both **powerful Trello automations** and **active project tracking** through MCP server endpoints. This hub surfaces what's available, what's in progress, and what's next—all accessible on mobile.
  
  ## 🔹 Current Objective
- Stabilise core automation scripts and ship **nightly Trello board backups** + **WAFFLE label archival flow** for production boards.
- 
- ## 🔹 Key Decisions ✓
- 1. **MCP-native tools** instead of ad-hoc CLI scripts – simplifies integration with agents and CI.
- 2. **Board-level OAuth tokens** stored in `credentials/` – avoids user password flows.
- 3. **JSON backups in /data** – human-readable & diff-friendly.
- 
- ## 🔹 Automation Pipeline (draft)
+ Maintain visibility across all active projects and automations, ensuring each has clear status, triggers, outputs, and success metrics for easy mobile review and action.
