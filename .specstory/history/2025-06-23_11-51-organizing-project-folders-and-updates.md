Prompt Purpose:  
Transform any messy or unclear question into a clear, actionable prompt and provide an immediate, high-quality answer in a single step, while ensuring all needed clarifications are gathered up front.

Context:  
You will receive a message that starts with this instruction and is followed by a user's messy or voice-transcribed question. Your job is to process the following as described.

Instruction:  
1. Carefully read the user’s question.
2. If anything in the question is unclear, ambiguous, or missing, pause and list ALL necessary clarification questions under a section titled "Clarification Needed". Do NOT proceed further until these are answered.
3. Once you have all necessary information, rewrite the user’s question into a clear, specific, and actionable prompt under a section titled "Improved Prompt".
4. Immediately provide the best possible answer to the improved prompt under a section titled "Answer".
5. Always use clear section headers: "Clarification Needed" (if applicable), "Improved Prompt", and "Answer".
6. Keep prompts and answers practical, relevant, and easy to understand.

Output Format:  
If clarification is needed:
---
Clarification Needed:  
[list all clarification questions]

(Wait for user response before proceeding.)

If no clarification is needed, or after clarification is supplied:
---
Improved Prompt:  
[the rewritten, clear version of the question]

Answer:  
[the high-quality, actionable answer]
---

Default to a clear and practical style suitable for general users unless otherwise specified.

All right, so we need to get this under control today, very very soon. What I mean by that is that we have too many folders with too many projects. I'm not even able to keep track of all the projects. Am I looking at too many projects at the same time? What are the latest with the product? We haven't opened the MCP in over way way too long. I need to show you where files are. You need to bring those files into this one space that we need to organise ourselves and then update each other. 

I think you should know what tools you have at your disposal, what can help you and all other kinds of things like that. So maybe you should take a quick examination of the area, ask me any questions you need to. You can feel free to look at the specstory folder for previous conversations, but obviously there's way newer conversations elsewhere. We need to figure that out as well. 

You have access to a superior prompting tool as well that can give any kind of text context and it can make a better prompt for you. I don't know what the system prompt is for it but it can make a better prompt. In terms of the current projects that we actually have: - There's this by-hand folder which is me actually manually making folders using Finder and it was me trying to figure out what would be a better layout for the actual project. - Chats - it was just me trying to throw in different chats from different places We still have an ongoing thing that we need to do. There's also this new thing that I'm trying where I do a stream of my thoughts in one document and then I could be pasting that in. Maybe that could help us update and know where we are on things and know what is tied to actual work and what isn't tied to actual work. Obviously you're going to need to ask a bunch of clarifying questions.
