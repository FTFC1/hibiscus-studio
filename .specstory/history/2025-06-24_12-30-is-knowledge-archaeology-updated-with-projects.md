You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀. 

🔹 Snapshot  
• `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/` only contains two sub-folders: `GAS` and `Retail`.  
• `projects/` has seven: `01-hibiscus-studio`, `02-retail`, `03-gas-solutions`, `04-fitness`, `05-personal-development`, `06-crm-role`, `07-ad-hoc`.  

🔹 Verdict  
No – the knowledge-archaeology repo is not up to date with everything in `projects`. It’s missing Hibiscus-Studio, Fitness, Personal-Development, CRM-Role, and Ad-Hoc.  

🔹 Quick Fix Path  
1. Decide which of the missing project folders you want archived first.  
2. Copy each project’s key assets (docs, code, creative, artefacts) into matching sub-folders under `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/`.  
3. Run/trigger your existing processing script (if any) so that `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/*` and the manifest get refreshed.  
4. Commit the new inputs + generated outputs so the knowledge base stays in sync. 🤖

+ # Gmail Management Instructions - Hibiscus Studio
+ 
+ ## 🔍 **Email Search Strategy**
+ 
+ ### Primary Search Queries for Daily Email Checks:
+ 
+ 1. **Today's Emails:**
+    ```
+    after:2025/06/20
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. **All Unread Emails (Most Important):**
+    ```
+    is:unread
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. **Business Enquiries (Custom Label):**
+    ```
+    label:enquiries
+    ```
+ 
+ 4. **Unread Enquiries Outside Inbox:**
+    ```
+    is:unread -in:inbox
+    ```
+ 
+ 5. **Recent Unread (Last 3 Days):**
+    ```
+    is:unread after:2025/06/17
+    ```
+ 
+ ## 🏷️ **Gmail Label System**
+ 
+ - **INBOX**: New emails, may get moved to custom labels
+ - **Label_7002953129239386366**: Custom "enquiries" label
+ - **IMPORTANT**: Gmail's auto-importance marking
+ - **CATEGORY_PERSONAL**: Gmail's category system
+ - **CATEGORY_UPDATES**: Automated notifications
+ - **SENT**: Outgoing emails
+ - **UNREAD**: Critical status - emails needing attention
+ 
+ ## ⚠️ **Key Insight**
+ When emails are moved from INBOX to custom labels (like "enquiries"), they:
+ - ✅ Keep UNREAD status
+ - ❌ Lose INBOX label
+ - 🎯 **Result**: Standard inbox searches miss them!
+ 
+ ## 📧 **Email Formatting Rules**
+ 
+ ### ❌ DON'T USE:
+ - **Bold markdown** (asterisks) - doesn't work when pasted into Gmail
+ - Bullet points with asterisks or dashes
+ - Complex formatting that requires manual cleanup
+ 
+ ### ✅ DO USE:
+ - Plain text with clear line breaks
+ - Simple numbered lists
+ - Clear paragraph separation
+ - Short, digestible sentences
+ - Assume recipients need simple, clear information
+ 
+ ## 🏢 **Business Context - Hibiscus Studio**

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 What I Did  
1. Audited `projects/` vs. `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/`.  
2. Created “lightweight snapshots” for every missing project:  
   • 01-hibiscus-studio (README, STATUS, key Gmail SOP)  
   • 04-fitness (README, STATUS)  
   • 05-personal-development (README, STATUS, my-tool-stack)  
   • 06-crm-role (README placeholder)  
   • 07-ad-hoc (README placeholder)  
3. Appended those files to `knowledge-manifest.md` so processors pick them up.  
4. Staged & committed everything (`chore(knowledge-archaeology): add lightweight snapshots…`).  

🔹 Next Steps  
• If you need more detail for CRM-Role or Ad-Hoc, drop individual docs into their snapshot folders.  
• Run your usual processors to regenerate any outputs that depend on the manifest.  
• Push whenever you’re ready (`git push`).  

All caught up – your knowledge base now mirrors the projects tree without the bloat. 🤖

Tasks in't the task-master mcp task, i mean todo withthe projects i have going

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 North-Star  
Build a single “Task Intelligence Loop” that:  
1. Stores every actionable in one **canonical queue** (Trello).  
2. Syncs lightweight status files in each project folder to and from that queue.  
3. Lets a short command (or chat question) run a scoring rule (“MIT selector”) and return the #1 focus item.  

🔹 Key Design Principles  
• Single source of truth → Trello cards hold authority.  
• Everything else is **mirrors**: project `STATUS.md`, knowledge-archaeology snapshots, Slack/Telegram reminders.  
• Lightweight metadata only (status, priority, effort, deadline).  
• Automations do the shuffling; you only decide priorities.  

🔹 Trello Board Architecture  
1. Lists  
   • **Backlog
