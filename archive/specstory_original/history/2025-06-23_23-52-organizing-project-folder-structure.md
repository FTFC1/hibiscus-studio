# Organizing project folder structure (2025-06-24 00:52:41)

All of the projects are in the projects folder, so that is the gas solutions basically Hibiscus ones all need to be just one Hibiscus and not three. Then you have Retail, then we also have now Delphi, and we also have Nigerian Budget Research to my knowledge. And then I guess we also have Fitness. Do I have a preferred top-level for the structure? If you could show me three, and then I can pick from there. Should be archived to the old move the older archive in active like legacy chest. I mean you can remove them, but suggest how you're going to move them. Where would you like this Stream of Thought document stored? What would be called? I think it should be just called Stream of Thought and it should probably be in the parent folder.

Is the MTB task system also still the single source of truth? No, it isn't anymore. Um really I want the single source of truth to be yes we need to decide what makes sense of where it should go.

So what I really want is that we have this as the parent folder, then all of this stuff that I've now opened in separate Finder cursor windows as projects are just folders within this parent folder that make more sense. Any size limits? No. How should we prioritise by earliest deadline and revenue potential or something else? Yeah, it's probably earliest deadline and revenue potential, and then also how much effort I'm getting putting into each one by logs and stuff that you know we're getting that this is good.
