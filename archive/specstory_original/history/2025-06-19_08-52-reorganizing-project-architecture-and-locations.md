# Reorganizing project architecture and locations (2025-06-19 09:52:20)

_**User**_

I wanna come up with a new architecture where all of my projects are in projects, and all of the summarisations of my projects are in knowledge architecture. Now obviously you're going to need to know exactly where my projects are, and we're going to have to move them. I wonder if it will be too cumbersome.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Current Project Architecture Analysis**

Right, let me map out what you've got:

**Current Projects (in `projects/`):**
- forje-certification
- gas-solutions  
- hibiscus-studio
- hibiscus-studio-landing
- hibiscus-studio-pages
- retailtm-landing

**Project Knowledge (in `knowledge-archaeology/`):**
- **Inputs:** GAS, Retail project files
- **Outputs:** GAS, Retail, HibiscusStudio, TrelloMCP summaries

**Infrastructure (in `supporting-systems/`):**
- trello-integration
- gmail-integration
- financial tools
- utilities

🔹 **Proposed Clean Architecture**

```
trello-mcp/
├── projects/                    # ALL actual projects
│   ├── gas-solutions/          # ✅ already here
│   ├── retail-solutions/       # 🔄 consolidate retail stuff
│   ├── hibiscus-studio/        # ✅ already here  
│   ├── forje-certification/    # ✅ already here
│   └── trello-mcp/            # 🔄 move from supporting-systems
│
├── knowledge-archaeology/       # ALL project intelligence
│   ├── inputs/
│   │   └── project-files/      # Raw project data
│   ├── outputs/
│   │   └── project-summaries/  # Processed insights
│   └── processors/             # ✅ already here
│
└── supporting-systems/          # Pure infrastructure
    ├── financial/
    ├── gmail-integration/
    └── utilities/
```

🔹 **Migration Plan**

**Step 1: Consolidate Retail**
- Move `knowledge-archaeology/inputs/project-files/Retail/` → `projects/retail-solutions/`
- Keep summaries in `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/Retail/`

**Step 2: Move Trello MCP**
- Move `supporting-systems/trello-integration/` → `projects/trello-mcp/`
- Keep summaries in `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/TrelloMCP/`

**Step 3: Clean Supporting Systems**
- Keep only pure infrastructure (financial, gmail, utilities)

This won't be cumbersome - it'll actually make navigation much cleaner. Want me to execute this migration? 🤖

I want you to look at this and ask yourself, "Is this the best clean architecture or is there something that's missing here?"

For example, yes we have the output, we have these project summaries. I think project summary is you need to state because each time each project should have like x number of files right? Ambiguities and there were like two others I've forgotten what they were.

🔹 **Gap Analysis of the Proposed Layout**

1. **Summary “starter-pack” isn’t enforced**  
   • Today each project’s `knowledge-archaeology/outputs/<Project>/` folder contains a random mix of files (README, ambiguities, maps, concepts, etc.).  
   • A clean architecture needs a *fixed* set of artefacts so every project looks identical at a glance.

2. **No place for “live” project management data**  
   • You keep Taskmaster tasks under various paths (`supporting-systems/trello-integration/tasks`, sub-repos, etc.).  
   • That information is just as “knowledge” as the summaries and belongs beside them (or at least under one predictable root).

3. **Supporting-systems = code or infra?**  
   • Some sub-folders here are genuine *projects* (e.g. `trello-integration`) while others are pure tooling (financial scripts).  
   • Mixing the two blurs the intention of `projects/` vs infra.

4. **No automation guard-rails**  
   • Nothing reminds you to regenerate summaries when code changes or to add the missing artefacts when spinning up a new project.

---

🔹 **Refined Directory Schema**

```
trello-mcp/
├── projects/
│   └── <project>/
│       ├── src/                # code / notebooks / design assets
│       ├── docs/               # in-repo docs (ADR, Swagger, etc.)
│       └── README.md           # dev-facing
│
├── knowledge-archaeology/
│   ├── inputs/
│   │   └── project-files/<project>/
│   ├── outputs/
│   │   └── <project>/          # 🔽 “summary starter-pack”
│   │       ├── README.md           # high-level narrative
│   │       ├── ambiguities.md      # open questions / risks
│   │       ├── profile.json        # canonical facts (owners, stack…)
│   │       ├── knowledge-map.txt   # concept graph / links
│   │       └── changelog.md        # (auto-gen) evolution of insights
│   └── tasks/                  # ✨ NEW
│       └── <project>.json      # Taskmaster export or link
│
├── infra/                      # ✨ rename supporting-systems
│   ├── trello-mcp/             # this *is* a project → move to projects/
│   ├── gmail-integration/      # stays (pure infra)
│   └── financial/              # stays
└── scripts/ci/                 # auto-generate summaries, lint packs
```

*Key points*  
• Every project now has **exactly five** summary artefacts – easy to diff and grep.  
• Tasks live in `knowledge-archaeology/tasks` so you can query “knowledge” in one sweep (code-agnostic).  
• `infra/` keeps only cross-project tooling; any real deliverable moves to `projects/`.  
• A small CI script (`scripts/ci/generate-summaries.js`) can fail if a project’s summary pack is missing files or stale.

🔹 **What’s Still Optional / TBD**

1. **Monorepo vs multi-repo** – Today you’re happy in one repo; if a project ever becomes client-facing code you might extract it.  
2. **Granular sub-domains** – e.g. split `projects/hibiscus-studio/` into `frontend/`, `backend/`, etc. when it grows.  
3. **Data vs Code snapshots** – Raw CSVs/JSON like `discovered_companies_*.csv` might eventually live under a dedicated `data/` root if they balloon.

---

🔹 **Next Steps**

1. Approve the refined schema (or tweak it).  
2. Generate a template `summary-starter-pack` folder we can copy for each project.  
3. Write the CI guard script.  
4. Physically move `trello-integration` → `projects/trello-mcp/` and create missing summary packs for any project that’s light.

Happy to script the moves and scaffold everything in one go – just say the word. 🤖

I think the way in which Taskmaster works is very different now. I don't know if it still uses a task folder. Can you check online and get the latest?
