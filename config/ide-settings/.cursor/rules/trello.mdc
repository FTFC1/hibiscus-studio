# Trello MCP Rules & Preferences

## **🚨 CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES (ALWAYS FOLLOW)**

### **4-Project Maximum Rule**
- **NEVER exceed 4 active projects** in the Active Projects list
- If adding a 5th project, MUST move one existing project to "Upcoming Priorities"
- Monitor project count before any card operations
- Quality over quantity - focus ensures completion

### **Mandatory Card Linking**
- **ALWAYS link related cards** when creating or updating
- **Active Projects MUST link to related cards** in other lists
- Use Trello's card linking feature (not just mentions in descriptions)
- Example: Gas Power project links to WHX event card, Me-OS project links to related tools
- Links show dependencies and connections visually

### **Checklist-Driven Action Management**
- **User determines next actions via CHECKLISTS, not descriptions**
- **ALWAYS create actionable checklist items** for new project cards
- **Descriptions = context/background**, **Checklists = what to do next**
- When user asks "what's next" - refer to unchecked checklist items
- Update checklists more frequently than descriptions

## **Card Positioning & Placement**

- **New Cards Always Go to Top or Second Position**
  - When adding new cards to any list, use `pos: "top"` parameter
  - If "top" conflicts with existing priority card, use second position
  - This ensures newest/most relevant cards are immediately visible
  - Apply this rule automatically for all `add_card_to_list` operations

## **Card Creation Standards**

- **Required Fields:**
  - Always include descriptive titles
  - Add context in description with source/reasoning
  - Include creation timestamp note: "Added via Trello MCP"
  - **Create actionable checklist items immediately**

- **URL Handling:**
  - When adding YouTube/web links, format as: `📺 [URL]` or `🔗 [URL]`
  - Include brief context about why the link was added
  - Use appropriate emoji prefixes for different content types

- **Project Card Requirements:**
  - Must have at least 3-5 actionable checklist items
  - Must link to related cards in other lists
  - Description provides context, checklist provides actions
  - Regular checklist updates as project progresses

## **List Management & Organization**

- **Active Projects (Max 4):**
  - Current working projects only
  - Each must have actionable checklists
  - Must link to related supporting cards
  - Move to Upcoming if exceeding limit

- **Upcoming Priorities:**
  - Next projects to tackle
  - Buffer for Active Projects overflow
  - Can have more detailed planning here

- **Review & Info Needed:**
  - Temporary holding for unclear items
  - Should be processed and moved regularly
  - Don't let cards accumulate here

## **Workflow Consistency Rules**

- **Before Every Card Operation:**
  1. Check if Active Projects count < 4
  2. Identify related cards that need linking
  3. Determine if checklists need updating
  4. Apply positioning rules (top/second)

- **When Creating Project Cards:**
  1. Add to appropriate list (respect 4-project limit)
  2. Create immediate actionable checklist items
  3. Link to related existing cards
  4. Position according to rules

- **When Updating Cards:**
  1. Focus on checklist items over description edits
  2. Maintain/update card links
  3. Keep actions scannable and clear

## **Memory & Context Rules**

- **Always remember these patterns:**
  - User scans checklists for next actions
  - Linking shows project relationships
  - 4-project focus maintains quality
  - Positioning rules improve visual clarity

- **Consistent Application:**
  - Apply these rules in every Trello interaction
  - Don't forget linking requirements
  - Always check project count limits
  - Prioritize checklist updates

**🎯 Goal:** Maintain focused, actionable, well-connected project management that matches user's natural workflow patterns.

## **MCP Tool Usage**

- **Default Parameters:**
  ```typescript
  // Always use top positioning for new cards
  await addCardToList(listId, {
    name: cardName,
    description: cardDescription,
    pos: "top"  // 🔹 REQUIRED: New cards go to top
  });
  ```

- **Error Handling:**
  - If `pos: "top"` fails, retry with `pos: 1` (second position)
  - Log positioning choices for debugging
  - Confirm card placement after creation

## **Content Formatting**

- **Descriptions:**
  - Start with relevant emoji (📺 🔗 📝 💡 etc.)
  - Include source/context
  - End with "Added via Trello MCP" signature

- **Titles:**
  - Keep concise but descriptive
  - Use title case for consistency
  - Include content type hint when relevant

## **Workflow Integration**

- **Voice OS Integration:**
  - Cards created from voice transcripts include audio context
  - Mark voice-derived cards with 🎤 prefix
  - Include original transcript excerpt in description

- **Daily Planning:**
  - Sunday Playlist items go to Active Projects
  - Review items get moved to 👀 Review list
  - Ideas go to 📥 Project Ideas for later processing

## **List Management**

- **Active Projects Priority:**
  - Use 🔥 Active Projects for current/today items
  - Move completed items to ✅ Completed immediately
  - Keep active list lean (max 10-15 cards)

- **Automatic Sorting:**
  - Most recently updated cards should appear at top
  - Use `move_card_to_top_of_list` when updating existing cards
  - Maintain chronological relevance in list ordering

## **Content Organisation**

- **Daily/Weekly Items:**
  - Use time-based prefixes: "Sunday Playlist", "Monday Tasks"
  - Group related content with consistent naming
  - Archive time-sensitive cards after completion

- **Priority Indicators:**
  - 🔥 High priority / Today
  - ⚡️ In progress / Active work
  - 📝 Planning / Future work
  - ✅ Completed / Archive ready

## **Automation Rules**

- **Card Updates:**
  - When modifying existing cards, automatically move to top of list
  - Update modification timestamp in description
  - Maintain activity log for important changes

- **List Hygiene:**
  - Auto-archive cards older than 30 days in completed
  - Suggest moving stale "Active" cards to planning
  - Keep lists organised and relevant
