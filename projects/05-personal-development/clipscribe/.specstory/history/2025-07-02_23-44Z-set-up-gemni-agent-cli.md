The user wants me to spin up a Gemini agent CLI and get the first message so they can sort out permissions etc. They want me to use the web to help me with this. This is going to open in terminal.

The user is in a project called "clipscribe" which seems to be a TypeScript/React app. I need to understand what they're asking for exactly - they want a CLI for Gemini (Google's AI model) that they can interact with directly from terminal.

Let me first search the web to understand how to set up a Gemini CLI agent, then implement it.

Since they mentioned "permissions etc", this likely involves setting up API keys and authentication with Google's Gemini API.

Let me search for information about Gemini CLI setup.</details></think>
