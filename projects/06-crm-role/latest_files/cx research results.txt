# Mikano CX Strategy v2 - Practical Revenue Growth Plan

## 🔹 Revenue Growth Path

**How 25% revenue growth happens in 12 months:**
• **Reduce drop-offs**: Currently losing customers between Instagram inquiry → purchase. 12-hour response standard captures 60% more leads (*industry data*)
• **Increase purchase frequency**: Customers who buy cars don't know Mikano sells generators. Simple WhatsApp broadcasts can drive 15% cross-division sales
• **Boost after-sales revenue**: Annual maintenance contracts currently underutilized. Proactive reminders + service history visibility can triple uptake
• **Stop revenue leakage**: Customers paying but not receiving products = reputation damage. Fix delivery tracking to retain high-value clients
• **Word-of-mouth amplification**: Nigerian market is relationship-driven. Better service = customers bring friends/family

**Quick math**: If 100 customers buy cars/month, and we convert just 15 to generator customers (₦2M average), that's ₦30M additional monthly revenue from cross-selling alone.

## 🔹 Fix Data Foundation

**Current Reality**: 
Data lives in ERP database → Excel exports → Power BI dashboards. But customer appears multiple times, no unique ID at awareness stage.

**Phase 1 Solution (Month 1-2)**:
• **Customer Master Sheet**: Create single Excel file combining all division data using email/phone as unique ID
• **Weekly Data Reconciliation**: Data team runs SQL query from ERP, exports to Excel, uses VLOOKUP to match customers across divisions
• **Standardize Phone Format**: +234XXXXXXXXXX format enforced (many customers use multiple formats)
• **Tag Customer Type**: Individual/Corporate/Government with dedicated columns
• **Service History Tab**: Link all purchases, services, complaints per customer

**Why This Matters**: Sales team can instantly see "Oh, Mr. Adeleke who wants a car already bought 3 generators from us" = trusted customer = faster close.

## 🔹 Track Without Spying

**The Nigerian Challenge**:
People don't want to be tracked. But we need data to serve them better.

**Non-Intrusive Tracking Approach**:
• **Activity Scorecards, Not Surveillance**: Track outcomes (deals closed, customers happy) not activities (calls made, hours worked)
• **Team Dashboards**: Show team performance, not individual tracking. "Lagos Team: 85% response rate" not "John: 23 calls today"
• **Customer-Facing Metrics**: "Your inquiry will be answered within 12 hours" - makes tracking about customer benefit
• **Weekly Check-ins**: Replace daily monitoring with weekly team reviews of what's working
• **Celebrate Wins**: Use data to reward success, not punish failures

**Simple Start**: Google Sheet with columns: Date | Customer Name | Inquiry Source | Response Time | Outcome | Notes. Team updates once daily.

## 🔹 Attribution That Works

**Challenge**: Customer sees Instagram post, WhatsApp messages asking "how much?" - how do we track this?

**Nigerian-Adapted Attribution**:

**For Digital (WhatsApp/Instagram)**:
• **Conversation Codes**: When someone asks "how much?" on Instagram, response includes: "Current promo price is X. Mention 'IG-DEC' when you visit"
• **WhatsApp Templates**: Create saved responses with tracking: "Thanks for your interest! Save this message and show at showroom for special pricing"
• **Source Question**: Train sales to casually ask "By the way, where did you first hear about this car/generator?" during conversation

**For Offline (Radio/Billboard/Print)**:
• **Location-Based Codes**: "Visit our Lekki showroom and mention 'LEKKI-PROMO' for discount"
• **Time-Based Tracking**: "This week only - mention you heard our Cool FM ad for bonus"
• **Unique Phone Numbers**: Different last 4 digits for each campaign (080X-XXX-1234 for radio, -1235 for billboard)

**Example**: 
- Radio ad says: "Call 0803-XXX-1234 and mention 'COOL FM' for special December pricing"
- Sales logs: Source = Radio, Code = COOL FM
- Monthly report shows: Radio generated 47 qualified leads, 12 purchases = ₦24M revenue

## 🔹 Response Standards

**12-Hour Rule Implementation**:

**Hour 0-2**: Auto-response acknowledging inquiry
- WhatsApp: "Thank you for your interest! Our sales specialist will contact you within 12 hours"
- Include: Basic info link, showroom locations

**Hour 2-8**: Qualified response
- Sales reviews inquiry, sends personalized message
- Books appointment if customer ready
- Provides specific information requested

**Hour 8-12**: Follow-up if no response
- "Hi [Name], just following up on your [product] inquiry. When would be good to discuss?"

**Escalation**: Manager alerted at hour 10 if no response sent

**Why 12 hours?**: Nigerians expect quick response but understand business hours. 24 hours loses 60% of hot leads.

## 🔹 Dealer Standardization

**Specific Behaviors to Standardize**:

**Pricing Discipline**:
• Dealers must quote within 5% of official price
• Any discount over 5% requires head office approval via WhatsApp
• Monthly mystery shopping to check compliance

**Customer Treatment Standards**:
• Greet within 30 seconds of arrival
• Offer water/soft drink for any discussion over 10 minutes
• Test drives available same day (not "come back tomorrow")
• Business card + brochure given to every visitor

**Follow-up Protocol**:
• Call within 48 hours of showroom visit
• WhatsApp/SMS after 1 week if no purchase
• Add to monthly newsletter list

**Inventory Promises**:
• Only promise delivery dates you can meet
• If car not available, offer specific alternatives
• Weekly inventory updates to all dealers via WhatsApp group

**Enforcement**: Monthly dealer scorecard affects their allocation of popular models.

## 🔹 Cross-Division Opportunities

**In Simple Terms**: 
"Help divisions sell to each other's customers without being pushy"

**How It Actually Works**:

**Scenario 1 - Car Buyer Profile**:
- Customer buys SUV = likely has large family
- System flags: "Generator opportunity - family size"
- 3 months later: "Many SUV owners love our home generators for family comfort. Interest?"

**Scenario 2 - Generator Buyer Profile**:
- Business buys 500KVA generator = expanding operations
- System flags: "Fleet opportunity - business growth"
- Sales gets alert: "Check if they need delivery vehicles"

**Scenario 3 - Construction Client**:
- Building luxury homes = high-end buyers
- System flags: "Premium car opportunity"
- Partnership opportunity for showroom events

**Not Pushy Because**:
- Wait 3+ months after initial purchase
- Frame as "helping your business grow"
- Offer value-add content first, sales second

## 🔹 Service Excellence

**Replacing Remote Monitoring**:

**Proactive Service Calls**:
• Day 30: "How's your new car/generator?"
• Day 90: "Time for first service - book now?"
• Day 365: "Annual maintenance due - special rate"

**Service History Visibility**:
• Customer portal (simple web page) shows:
  - Purchase date and warranty status
  - Service records with dates/costs
  - Next recommended service
  - Parts replaced history

**WhatsApp Service Updates**:
• "Your generator service started - completion by 3pm"
• "Service complete - invoice attached"
• Photo of work done

**Predictive Maintenance**:
• Based on average usage patterns
• "Customers with your generator model typically need XYZ at 18 months"
• Proactive parts ordering

## 🔹 CRM Value Explained

**Why CRM Matters** (in business terms):

**Without CRM**: 
- Customer calls about generator. You don't know they bought 3 cars from you = treat like stranger = lost trust
- Sales rep leaves = customer relationships leave with them
- Can't answer "How many customers bought both cars and generators?"

**With CRM**:
- See complete customer history instantly = personalized service
- Any team member can help any customer
- Identify your most valuable customers for VIP treatment
- Spot trends: "Customers who buy X often need Y"

**CRM Tiers for Mikano**:

**Tier 1 - Enhanced Excel** (₦0-50K/month):
- Structured templates with macros
- Shared on company network
- Power BI integration ready
- Good for <1,000 active customers

**Tier 2 - Cloud CRM** (₦200-500K/month):
- HubSpot, Zoho, or similar
- Mobile access for field teams
- Automated follow-ups
- API connections possible
- Good for growth phase

**Tier 3 - Enterprise** (₦2M+/month):
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics
- Full ERP integration
- Advanced analytics
- Custom workflows
- Only when ready for full digital transformation

**Recommendation**: Start Tier 1, plan for Tier 2 in 6 months.
