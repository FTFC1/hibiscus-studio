# User Feedback & Preferences Log

This document tracks key feedback and stylistic preferences to ensure consistency and avoid repetition in our collaboration.

## Document Style & Formatting
- **Clarity is Key**: Use simple, direct language. Assume writing for a smart 16-year-old who is busy. Shorter sentences are better.
- **Professional Framing**: Titles and section headings should be professional and impactful (e.g., "Project Blueprint," "Risk: Misaligned Processes & Incentives" instead of "Politics").
- **Structured Arguments**: For journeys and risks, use a clear `Problem -> Solution -> Why it Matters` or `Problem -> Mitigation` format.
- **Visuals**: Prefer simple, robust markdown tables over complex diagrams (like Mermaid) that can break. All visuals must be clean and professional.
- **Clear Definitions**: Define key roles like "Data Steward" clearly and concisely within the document.

## Core Project Concepts
- **ERP is for Customer Master Data**: When discussing the ERP in the context of this project, focus on its role as the source of truth for **customer master data**. Avoid mentioning "financial data" to prevent confusion and resistance.
- **Excel Hub as a User-Adoption Tool**: Position the Excel Hub as a fast, user-friendly tool designed to *increase the rate of interaction logging* because the ERP is seen as too slow for this task. It's a solution to a data capture problem.
- **Clarify Scope**: Action plans must be explicit about which division(s) they apply to (e.g., "This is a pilot for the Motors division").
