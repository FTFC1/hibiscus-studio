# One-Page Blueprint: A Unified Customer Experience
_For Executive Review_

---

### 🔹 The Problem
We are leaving money on the table and damaging our brand because of disconnected processes. The core issues are:
*   **Lost Conversations**: Key interactions are not logged, **leading to an incomplete customer view and a weak sales pipeline.**
*   **Missed Opportunities**: Without a shared customer history, we cannot effectively cross-sell, **leaving significant revenue on the table.**
*   **Inconsistent Service**: Customers get a different answer depending on who they talk to, **which erodes trust and damages our brand.**

### 🔹 The Solution: A "Process-First" Strategy
Our strategy is to de-risk a future CRM investment by proving the process works manually first. We will use the pilot to build the right habits and a data-driven business case for the right technology.

| Our Strategy | Our Action | The Business Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standardise the Process** | Use a **Microsoft Form** to log all interactions in a protected Excel Hub. | Prevents chaos and creates a single source of truth for all customer data. |
| **Build the Right Habits** | Use the Hub to run weekly, data-driven team reviews. | Drives a culture of collaboration and accountability. |
| **Prove the ROI First** | The pilot will generate a **CRM Requirements Document** based on real user needs. | Guarantees any future software investment is based on a proven, working model. |

### 🔹 The Rollout: Prove Value, Then Scale
We will start with a focused pilot to create a blueprint for success before expanding.

| Phase | Division(s) | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Motors Division** | Build a successful system and prove the value of this approach. |
| **Phase 2+**| Power, Medical & Others | Apply lessons learned to roll out across the entire business. |
