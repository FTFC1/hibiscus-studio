# MID-MARKET IPP TARGETS - High-Volume Lead Generation

## Executive Summary & Methodology

**Goal**: Build systematic ₦400-600M+ annual commission pipeline (4-6 deals/year) through high-volume, mid-market IPP lead generation.

**Methodology**: Initial detailed analysis of ~27 companies (₦500M-₦3B power costs) to refine value proposition. Strategy scales to ~230 new company outreaches per week (~11,000+ annually), leveraging data-driven targeting and a 3-step email sequence. Power cost estimates based on industry MW standards combined with Nigeria's current power pricing (₦90-150/kWh hybrid grid/diesel costs).

**Timeline**: Phased 12-18 month execution. Q2-Q3 2025: System setup & initial ramp-up. Q4 2025 onwards: Full-scale outreach, aiming for first deals in Q1/Q2 2026.

### Power Cost Calculation Methodology

**₦30.6bn Total Market Estimation:**
- **Source**: Industry standard MW requirements × Nigeria's hybrid power costs
- **Basis**: Company operational data cross-referenced with industrial power consumption benchmarks
- **Validation**: Individual company estimates totalled to ₦30.6bn across 25 targets

**Individual Company Calculations:**
- **Total Combined Power Costs**: ₦30.6bn per year
- **Average**: ₦30.6bn ÷ 25 companies = **₦1.224bn per company**

**Individual Company Range:**
- **Highest**: Indorama Eleme (₦2.1bn) - Petrochemical plant
- **Lowest**: WAMCO & Rite Foods (₦0.6bn each) - Smaller food processing
- **Most Common**: ₦0.8bn - ₦1.3bn range (16 out of 25 companies)

**How These Numbers Are Estimated:**
1. **MW Requirements**: Based on industry standards
   - Petrochemicals: 1.5-2.5MW per plant
   - Food processing: 0.7-1.4MW per facility
   - Pharmaceuticals: 1.2-1.7MW per factory

2. **Current Power Mix Costs** *(as of May 2025)*:
   - **NEPA grid**: ₦50-80/kWh (when available) - *requires current tariff verification*
   - **Diesel generators**: ₦120-200/kWh (backup power)
   - **Combined average**: ₦90-150/kWh depending on reliability needs
   - **Note**: NEPA rates may have changed following recent Dangote refinery pricing impact

3. **Annual Calculation Example (1.2MW company)**:
   - 1.2MW × 24 hours × 365 days = 10.5M kWh/year
   - 10.5M kWh × ₦120/kWh = **₦1.26bn annual power cost**

**Why These Companies Spend So Much:**
- Nigerian grid unreliable → Must run expensive diesel backup 60-80% of time
- Industrial operations → Cannot stop production for power outages
- High fuel costs → Diesel at ₦800+/litre makes generator power expensive

## Systematic Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Ramp-Up & System Setup (June 2025 - Q3 2025)
**Target**: Build lead database of 3,000+ companies. Test and refine outreach for first ~700 companies (scaling to 60-70/week by end of Q3).
- Validate lead sources and research efficiency.
- Establish email automation and tracking.

### Phase 2: Full-Scale Outreach Execution (Q4 2025 - Q3 2026)
**Volume**: Consistently outreach to ~230 new companies per week.
**Personalization**: Leverage news triggers & industry pain points at scale.
**Follow-up**: Automated 3-email sequence over 2 weeks.

### Phase 3: Optimization & Deal Progression (Ongoing from Q1 2026)
**Expand**: Continuously refresh lead database to maintain 11,000+ annual target.
**Systematize**: Automate news monitoring and lead enrichment.
**Optimize**: A/B test messaging, subject lines, and calls-to-action.
**Deal Progression**: Focus on moving qualified leads through to closure, aiming for 1-2 deals per quarter.

**Operational Targets (Weekly Average for ~230 new company outreach):
- **Email Outreach**: ~230 new companies / ~690 emails (with 3-step sequence)
- **Expected Responses**: ~13-14 per week (2% response rate on total emails)
- **Qualified Calls**: ~2 per week (15% of responses)

**Annual Targets (Aiming for 4-6 Deals):**
- **Revenue Goal**: ₦400M - ₦600M commissions annually (2% commission structure)
- **Deal Target**: 4-6 deals per year (1-2 per quarter starting Q1/Q2 2026 after initial ramp-up)
