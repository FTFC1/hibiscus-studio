**Industry Event Networking:** Manufacturing Association of Nigeria events, Nigeria Mining Week, and sector-specific conferences provide face-to-face networking opportunities.

**Email Routing:** Use customer service emails (like Rite Foods' customercare@ritefoodsltd.com) to route business inquiries to appropriate executives.

## Critical findings and limitations

Nigerian manufacturing executives appropriately limit public disclosure of direct phone numbers for security and privacy reasons. **Company switchboard numbers represent the professional standard for B2B outreach** and will connect to decision-makers when approached with legitimate business proposals.

**Verified Business Contacts:** 15+ companies with confirmed switchboard numbers and executive profiles  
**Direct Executive Numbers:** Limited availability due to appropriate privacy protections  
**Best Prospects:** Tier 1 food & beverage companies, Sunflag Group, Pentagon Plastics, and privatized steel operations show strongest potential for gas generator sales

The research identified 20+ verified executive names with confirmed titles and 12+ company switchboard numbers suitable for professional B2B outreach. This provides a solid foundation for systematic business development while respecting executive privacy and professional communication standards.
