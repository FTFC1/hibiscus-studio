## 8. RANBAXY NIGERIA LIMITED (Pharmaceutical Manufacturing)

### Deep Company Analysis

Ranbaxy Nigeria Limited, operating as a subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd since 2014, represents a significant multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing presence in Nigeria with over 35 years of operational experience. The company operates NAFDAC GMP-approved production facilities at Magboro, Ogun State, strategically located along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway within Nigeria's industrial corridor while maintaining access to major markets.

**Manufacturing Facility & Scale:** The Magboro facility spans 2.129 hectares and represents substantial infrastructure investment designed to manufacture both oral solid dosages and liquid formulations. Built under WHO GMP norms with international specifications, the facility maintains production capacity for approximately 36 million bottles of liquid formulations and 150-200 million tablets annually on multiple shift basis, indicating significant continuous power requirements.

**Power Infrastructure & Consumption:** This scale of production demands significant continuous power infrastructure, likely requiring 1MW+ capacity from multiple diesel generators given the facility size and production volume. The facility's capability to produce both solid and liquid dosage forms requires sophisticated equipment including tablet compression machines, liquid filling lines, blending equipment, coating systems, and packaging machinery, all demanding substantial electrical power.

**Product Portfolio & Market Position:** Manufacturing operations encompass a diverse pharmaceutical portfolio including well-known brands such as Gestid Suspension, Chericof, Brustan-N, Riconia, Fortwin, Sporidex, Roscilox, Ranferon Iron Tonic, Bacqure, Contiflo OD, Roliten, Rosart, and Neuronem. The company has secured exclusive tenders for Anti-Retroviral drug supply from Federal Ministry of Health, State Ministries, PEPFAR, Global Fund, and MSF.

**Strategic Positioning & Financial Backing:** The company maintains a strong local employment focus with 97% of workforce being Nigerian nationals, indicating significant local investment and job creation. Ranbaxy Nigeria's backing by Sun Pharma provides financial stability for infrastructure investments including power systems, with the parent company's resources supporting major facility upgrades and operational improvements.

**Current Operational Challenges:** Power infrastructure challenges are particularly acute given the facility's location in Ogun State where grid power reliability remains problematic. The company's ability to maintain continuous production for ARV drugs and other critical medications requires robust backup power systems with industry estimates suggesting pharmaceutical facilities of this scale maintain diesel generator capacity exceeding 1MW.
