Food & Beverage Manufacturing
Beloxxi Industries Limited (Biscuits – Ogun State)
Overview & Products: Beloxxi is a leading indigenous biscuit producer, famous for its Beloxxi Cream Crackers. Founded in 1994 (manufacturing since 2006), it has grown into the largest integrated cream cracker biscuit plant in Sub-Saharan Africa
financialnigeria.com
medium.com
. Beloxxi distributes across Nigeria and even exports within West Africa
financialnigeria.com
. Its product – a crispy, shelf-stable cracker – is a staple snack nationwide. Processes & Energy Intensity: Biscuit production is highly automated: Beloxxi’s Agbara factory runs 10 production lines with continuous dough mixing, stamping, baking ovens, and packaging machines
beloxxigroup.com
beloxxigroup.com
. This high-volume process is energy-intensive – ovens require consistent heat and motors drive conveyors and packaging equipment 24/7. Power can constitute up to 70% of manufacturing costs in Nigeria
theworldfolio.com
, so energy efficiency is crucial. Beloxxi uses modern machinery and reportedly maintains hygienic, efficient processes to maximize output per kWh
beloxxigroup.com
beloxxigroup.com
. The factory operates round-the-clock, targeting 100,000 metric tonnes per year capacity
beloxxigroup.com
 – a scale requiring multi-megawatt power supply. Power Infrastructure & Usage: Located in Agbara industrial estate (Ogun), Beloxxi faces Nigeria’s grid unreliability. The company installed substantial on-site generation to ensure uninterrupted production. During an expansion, Vice President Osinbajo praised the “groundbreaking facilities” as Beloxxi added new lines
beloxxigroup.com
. While specific figures are private, Beloxxi almost certainly runs large diesel generators (and possibly gas generators if pipeline access) to meet its ~1–2 MW power demand. Many Nigerian factories get barely 8 hours of grid power daily
archive.businessday.ng
, so Beloxxi’s generators likely supply the majority of its electricity. Management has noted generally that entrepreneurs must overcome power challenges (seen as just another hurdle)
theworldfolio.com
. Beloxxi’s CEO even downplayed power as “not the biggest challenge” compared to financing
theworldfolio.com
 – indicating the firm has adapted via self-generation. Diesel consumption can be inferred: similar food plants spend millions of naira weekly on fuel. We estimate Beloxxi easily spends ₦10–20 million monthly on diesel (if not more), given industry norms and 24/7 operations. This expense impacts margins but ensures stable production. There’s no evidence yet of solar or significant renewable adoption at Beloxxi, but the firm’s scale might justify future investments in captive power plants or gas turbines to reduce long-term energy cost. Financial Strength & CapEx: Beloxxi has attracted major investments to fund growth. In 2016 it secured an $80 million private equity injection (led by 8 Miles and African Capital Alliance)
financialnigeria.com
financialnigeria.com
. This funded its phase-2 and 3 expansion: adding new production lines and doubling capacity
financialnigeria.com
beloxxigroup.com
. The expansion (commissioned 2018) increased staff from 2,500 to 6,000 and output from 40,000 to 100,000 tons/year
beloxxigroup.com
beloxxigroup.com
. Such capital expenditure on technology and facilities shows strong financial backing and confidence in demand. Beloxxi’s revenues likely fall in the mid-tier range (estimated ₦5–15 billion annually), and the company has been profitable, reinvesting earnings into growth. It was even listed on the NASD OTC in 2016 when new investors came on board
beloxxigroup.com
. The company’s financial strength is also evidenced by its ability to carry the high operating costs (diesel, logistics) and still expand. In a challenging 2023 environment of inflation and FX devaluation, manufacturers’ costs soared; Beloxxi’s sector peers saw cost of sales double due to energy and input costs
guardian.ng
guardian.ng
. Beloxxi’s efficient operations and prior investments likely help buffer these shocks, keeping it competitive. Recent Expansion & Growth Strategy: Beloxxi has a clear growth trajectory. After completing the third expansion phase, it became the largest cracker biscuit producer in West Africa
financialnigeria.com
. The company’s strategy includes export expansion to ECOWAS markets, leveraging its increased capacity
financialnigeria.com
. CEO Obi Ezeude highlighted plans to earn foreign exchange by accessing neighboring markets
financialnigeria.com
. Domestically, Beloxxi has grown its distribution network and even gained visibility – e.g. its crackers were served at a Federal Minister’s swearing-in in 2019
beloxxigroup.com
. Beloxxi positions itself as a premium quality local alternative to imported biscuits, benefitting from Nigeria’s ban on biscuit imports since 2003 (which originally spurred its founding). In the competitive landscape, Beloxxi now rivals older biscuit giants (like Yale and OK Foods). A 2016 report put Beloxxi’s market share around 9%, behind leaders Yale (37%) and OK Foods
medium.com
medium.com
. With its new capacity, Beloxxi likely increased share, especially in the cream crackers segment where it dominates. It was recognized as “Manufacturer of the Year 2017” by The Sun, underscoring its industry leadership
beloxxigroup.com
. Going forward, Beloxxi’s growth strategy focuses on product quality, aggressive marketing, and possibly new product variants. It has hinted at exploring other snack categories once core capacity is optimized. Sustainability & ESG: As a food manufacturer, Beloxxi emphasizes hygiene and quality. It adheres to international food safety standards and likely has ISO certifications (though not publicly confirmed). In terms of ESG, Beloxxi’s impact includes employment of thousands of Nigerians and developing the local supply chain (it sources flour, oil and packaging locally where possible). The company has hosted government committees on industrial revival
beloxxigroup.com
, sharing knowledge to help resuscitate other factories – a form of industry advocacy. On environment, there’s little public info; however, like many in its sector, Beloxxi faces pressure to optimize energy use (perhaps upgrading to gas generators to cut carbon and cost). Any initiatives in waste recycling or community support are kept low-key. An area Beloxxi could explore is solar augmentation for daytime power – large roof spaces on its factory could host solar panels to offset diesel use. Notably, Beloxxi’s CEO is involved in youth empowerment dialogues
facebook.com
, and the firm’s expansion was lauded for its contribution to Nigeria’s industrialization
financialnigeria.com
. Overall, while not spotlighting ESG in media, Beloxxi’s core business of producing affordable food domestically has inherent social value (food security, employment). Improved power sustainability would be a logical next step for both cost and ESG gains. Key Decision-Makers – Beloxxi Industries Ltd: (Contact and personalization details for targeted outreach)

Rite Foods Limited (Beverages & Snacks – Ogun State)
Overview & Products: Rite Foods is a fast-rising Nigerian food & beverage manufacturer, known for its Bigi carbonated soft drinks, Fearless Energy Drink, bottled water, and Rite sausage rolls
guardian.ng
ng.linkedin.com
. Founded in 2007 as part of Ess-Ay Holdings, Rite Foods has become a major challenger to multinationals in the beverage market
guardian.ng
guardian.ng
. Its portfolio includes 13 flavors of Bigi soda (Cola, Orange, Apple, etc.), Fearless Classic and Red Berry energy drinks, and three sausage roll variants
ng.linkedin.com
ng.linkedin.com
. The company prides itself on “Truly World-Class, Proudly Nigerian” products and has won awards for quality
guardian.ng
. Rite’s main production facility is a 23.78-hectare industrial complex in Ososa, Ogun State, housing a bakery (for sausage rolls) and beverage bottling plant
uf-a.com
. Manufacturing Processes & Energy Intensity: Rite Foods’ operations span food baking and high-speed bottling. The sausage roll line involves dough mixing, baking, and packaging – continuous ovens and conveyors that consume substantial heat and electricity. The beverage lines are even more power-intensive: they include PET bottle fabrication (via injection/stretch blow molding), liquid processing (mixing, carbonation), high-speed filling (~40,000 bottles/hour machines), and cold storage. These processes require a constant power supply for compressors, motors, chillers, etc. Rite’s Ososa factory runs multiple shifts, effectively 24/7, to meet nationwide demand. The energy load is significant: at design, the site’s consumption was about 11 GWh/year (~1.25 MW average load)
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. This includes an on-site water treatment and refrigeration for drinks, and possibly boiler systems for the bakery. Operating all this in Nigeria mandates extensive power infrastructure. Power Infrastructure & Usage: Remarkably, Rite Foods’ Ososa plant is an off-grid site, not connected to PHCN’s public grid
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. The company initially ran entirely on diesel and gas generators to supply its ~1.3 MW power needs
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. This reflects the reality that grid power in semi-rural Ogun is unreliable for an operation of this scale. Rite Foods invested in a robust generator farm (“generator house” is mentioned as part of the facility
uf-a.com
), likely including multiple high-capacity diesel gensets (and possibly CNG/gas generators given Nigeria’s push for gas). To curb soaring diesel costs, Rite Foods took an innovative step: in 2019 it commissioned a 1 MW solar PV hybrid plant on-site
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. This solar farm supplies ~12% of the factory’s energy (about 82.5 MWh monthly) and is integrated with the generators
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. By day, solar offsets a chunk of diesel consumption. Nonetheless, the remaining ~88% demand is met by fossil fuel generation. The company’s diesel usage was very high – prior to solar, the site ran exclusively on gensets, consuming an estimated 1 million+ liters of diesel annually (plus natural gas for dual-fuel gensets)
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. At 2023 diesel prices, that’s over ₦700 million/year, far above ₦200 M. In interviews, Rite’s Managing Director noted Nigeria’s power woes drive such self-sufficiency, lamenting manufacturers’ reliance on expensive alternatives
pharmanewsonline.com
guardian.ng
. Rite Foods’ case confirms this: they proactively built generation and now renewables. The hybrid system demonstrates an ESG mindset and desire to cut energy costs. Additionally, Rite Foods likely has substantial backup power redundancy – multiple generator units to ensure critical systems (like freezers for drinks) never go down. The Ogun State government and partners have also worked on improving industrial power infrastructure (e.g. nearby 9 MW Ososa power plant)
guardian.ng
nigeriannewsdirect.com
, which might eventually benefit Rite Foods. Financial Strength & Expansion Investments: Rite Foods is a privately-held growth company whose revenue likely falls in the mid-tier ₦10–20 billion range. It has shown strong financial performance, rapidly gaining market share in beverages against giants. For example, its Bigi drinks and Fearless energy drinks achieved nationwide distribution within a few years, indicating sales volumes in the tens of millions of bottles (2019 data showed 13 Bigi flavors launched and widely accepted
guardian.ng
). The company reinvests heavily: in 2021 it expanded the beverage plant for new SKUs and ramped up marketing (sponsoring events, aggressive advertising). It has also spent on technology – e.g. acquiring “the best machinery obtainable worldwide” for its production lines
guardian.ng
. This aligns with the ₦7.5 billion invested in a world-class factory as of 2015 (similar scale to competitor’s plants)
expogr.com
. Rite’s parent Ess-Ay Holdings provides a solid capital base, enabling these large capital expenditures. The company’s financial stability is further seen in its CSR and outreach (they’ve done educational CSR programs
businessday.ng
) and its ability to absorb high operating costs. Rising diesel prices in 2023 have squeezed manufacturers’ margins nationwide
guardian.ng
, but Rite Foods managed to maintain growth – it even earned industry awards (Brand of the Year etc.) and increased exports to neighboring countries. The fact that it self-financed a solar plant suggests long-term financial planning to reduce OpEx. Overall, Rite Foods’ steady expansion in product lines and infrastructure indicates robust financial health and optimism in demand. Recent Developments & Growth Strategy: Rite Foods has been in expansion mode to consolidate its market position. In 2020–2021, it introduced new products (Fearless energy drink variants) and reportedly reached production of 13 million kg of sausages and beverages annually
businessday.ng
businessday.ng
. The Ogun State government in 2023 highlighted Rite Foods as a success story and pledged support for further expansion (Rite is considering adding capacity in Oyo State)
greenpowernig.com
. A key strategic focus is innovation: the MD Seleem Adegunwa emphasizes quality and “fanatical commitment to excellence”
guardian.ng
. Rite Foods leverages modern tech – for instance, it likely has an advanced ERP and automation (it has an ERP Solutions Architect on staff
ng.linkedin.com
). The company is also known for aggressive marketing to grow share (its Fearless drink took on an established competitor, leading to legal battles that Rite won). Another growth vector is export: Rite Foods has begun exporting Bigi drinks to West African markets, leveraging ECOWAS free trade. On operations, the firm looks to continuously improve efficiency; in 2024 it planned process optimizations to cut costs amid high inflation (e.g. lightweighting bottles, localizing raw materials). Rite Foods’ expansion in coming 6–12 months could include adding a new production line (the Ososa site has space and UF-A engineers designed it for modular growth
uf-a.com
). There are reports it may venture into new categories (e.g. dairy or malt drinks) to broaden its portfolio. All these require stable power – Rite’s hybrid energy approach may be scaled up (perhaps adding more solar capacity or battery storage to further trim diesel use). The company’s growth mindset and recent recognitions (e.g. EDGE Outstanding Legacy Brand Award 2023
authorityngr.com
) point toward continuing expansion and capital investments. Sustainability Practices: Rite Foods shows some sustainability consciousness, notably via its 1 MW solar hybrid plant that cuts carbon emissions (it reduces the site’s diesel/gas generation by ~12%, lowering CO₂ output proportionally)
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. This project earned a TotalEnergies award for reducing GHG by 97% per kWh vs diesel-only baseline
ecosolutions.totalenergies.com
. In waste management, Rite likely recycles PET bottle scraps and cartons internally (common in bottling operations). The company engages in community initiatives – e.g. it sponsors beach clean-ups (“RiteOnTheBeach” for environmental preservation)
brandinfo.com.ng
. It adheres to NAFDAC and SON quality standards, ensuring product safety (which is part of social responsibility). Rite’s large workforce (500+ employees
ng.linkedin.com
) enjoys a modern welfare-oriented facility (the Ososa complex includes staff welfare amenities
uf-a.com
). One ESG area to improve could be water usage; as a beverage maker, Rite consumes significant water – ensuring sustainable sourcing and treatment will be important (their customer care contacts indicate emphasis on quality control
ng.linkedin.com
). The firm’s power strategy is arguably a template for sustainable industrial growth in Nigeria – combining grid independence with renewables. Over the next year, Rite Foods is poised to further increase renewable share (maybe add another megawatt of solar or pilot battery storage to shave peak generator loads). They also continue to localize supply chains (supporting local farmers for cassava flour in snacks, etc.) which has economic sustainability benefits. While not heavily public about ESG, Rite’s actions (solar investment, CSR events) demonstrate a growing commitment to sustainability in practice. Key Decision-Makers – Rite Foods Ltd:

Industrial & Medical Gases Nigeria Plc (IMG) – (Industrial Gases – Lagos & PH)
Overview & Products: Industrial & Medical Gases Nigeria (formerly BOC Gases Nigeria) is the nation’s leading producer of industrial, medical and specialty gases. Founded over 60 years ago, IMG Plc manufactures oxygen, nitrogen, acetylene, argon, CO₂, helium, and gas mixtures used in healthcare and industry
img-ng.com
img-ng.com
. It also deals in welding equipment and engineering services
img-ng.com
. Headquartered in Lagos (Oshodi Industrial Estate) with production plants in Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna
img-ng.com
, IMG has the widest distribution network for gases in Nigeria. The company was a subsidiary of Linde Plc until 2021, when it was acquired by local investors (TY Holdings) and rebranded
thenationonlineng.net
thenationonlineng.net
. Annual revenues are in the mid-tier range (estimated ₦5–10 billion) and it’s listed on the NGX. Key products include medical oxygen cylinders for hospitals, nitrogen for oil & gas sector, CO₂ for beverage carbonation, and welding gases for fabrication. These gases are critical inputs across Nigerian industries, giving IMG a stable demand base. Processes & Energy Intensity: Gas production is highly energy-intensive due to compression and liquefaction processes. IMG primarily operates Air Separation Units (ASUs) – big plants that take in air and separate it into O₂, N₂, Argon via cryogenic distillation. ASUs run large compressor motors (often thousands of kW) to compress air, then expand and cool it to sub-zero temperatures. For example, producing liquid oxygen/nitrogen requires sustained operation of turbo-compressors, chillers and vacuum pumps. These machines must run continuously (24/7) to maintain product purity and keep cryogenic tanks filled. Even smaller gas plants (acetylene generators, CO₂ recovery units) use substantial power for pumps, heaters, etc. IMG’s plants likely each demand several megawatts; e.g. an ASU for 100 tons/day O₂ might use ~1.5–2 MW. Additionally, IMG’s cylinder filling stations use compressors and cascades to fill high-pressure cylinders, adding to the load. In sum, electricity is a major cost – historically energy could be 30–40% of gas production costs. The need for uninterrupted power is critical: a power dip can disrupt cryogenic distillation, leading to product losses and lengthy restart times. Thus, IMG’s facilities have heavy-duty electrical infrastructure and backup. Power Infrastructure & Usage: Given Nigeria’s grid unreliability, IMG has had to ensure self-sufficient power. The Lagos plant (Oshodi) is presumably connected to Ikeja DisCo’s industrial feeder, but even that can be erratic. On-site diesel generators are crucial. In fact, IMG had to rent additional generator capacity to support operations in recent years. According to financial reports, the company rented two large generators, capitalizing them under leases
doclib.ngxgroup.com
. These gen-sets produce so much electricity that IMG even supplied surplus power to a neighboring company (Cordeaux) – indicating IMG sometimes over-generated to stabilize its plant
doclib.ngxgroup.com
. This highlights both the scale of generation and the cost: running multiple 1,000 kVA diesel gensets full-time is extremely expensive. Indeed, energy cost is one reason the new owners are investing in efficiency. The company’s 2022 accounts show ₦82.95 million spent on electricity (likely diesel and PHCN) in admin costs
doclib.ngxgroup.com
 – and production energy would be even higher. A typical large manufacturer spent ₦5 million+ on diesel per month in past years
archive.businessday.ng
; with diesel prices up, IMG could easily be spending ₦15–20 million monthly on fuel. On top of diesel, IMG may use gas-fired generators: being in an industrial area, access to natural gas pipelines is possible. (Linde had considered gas engines for such plants historically.) The site in Port Harcourt (Eleme) might also tap into gas. However, persistent national gas shortages hamper that switch. Notably, “gas supply limitations” have impacted production – in Q3 2023, the company cited gas supply issues but later resolved them to resume operations
notore.com
notore.com
. This likely refers to feedstock gas for an on-site power plant or for CO₂ production, and underscores how fuel disruptions directly hurt output. In summary, IMG runs a hybrid of grid (when available) + diesel generators, and possibly gas generators, to meet its high continuous power needs. It sells oxygen and others to hospitals, so maintaining power 24/7 is literally life-or-death critical (for oxygen supply). The infrastructure includes backup redundancies – e.g. multiple gensets so maintenance can be staggered. The company likely has large diesel storage tanks and an in-house power distribution network (with switchgear to manage load between PHCN and gens). Any outage can force flaring of product or ruin a batch, so power reliability is a top operational priority. Financial Strength & CapEx Trends: After the 2021 takeover by TY Holdings, IMG has been retooling for growth. The new majority owner pumped in capital and set “ambitious commitments” to expand plant capacity and improve efficiency
thenationonlineng.net
thenationonlineng.net
. The rebranding and additional investment were intended to “strengthen global competitiveness”
thenationonlineng.net
thenationonlineng.net
. Financially, the company struggled in late 2010s due to forex issues and high costs, but 2021–2022 saw a turnaround: revenue in 2022 was ₦4.4 billion (up ~30%) and profit after tax ₦0.59 billion, indicating a modest but positive margin
businessday.ng
. With inflation and devaluation in 2023, costs rose, but IMG managed to reduce energy costs by 18% in some quarters by leveraging improved grid supply in clusters
businessday.ng
. It’s also likely benefitting from tax incentives being a listed manufacturing company. The company’s capital expenditure recently includes procurement of new plants and equipment
thenationonlineng.net
 – e.g. possibly a new mini-ASU or new delivery trucks to widen distribution. The board set new growth targets to expand within Nigeria and West Africa
thenationonlineng.net
. A hint: in 2022, IMG re-installed a CO₂ plant to capture carbon from a brewery, indicating capex on capacity expansion (CO₂ was in short supply nationally). The firm’s financial muscle is bolstered by TY Holdings (owned by Gen. T. Danjuma), so large projects (like installing a captive gas turbine or solar farm) could be funded if ROI justifies. Overall, IMG is financially stable in the mid-tier – generating enough cash to pay dividends (it resumed dividends in 2021)
offshore-technology.com
 and invest in upgrades. Its strategy is to grow volume to offset high fixed costs like power; thus far, volume is rising as manufacturing picks up post-COVID. The share price performance has been moderate, but investors see potential if costs (especially energy) can be controlled. Recent Expansion & Strategy: IMG’s strategic plan (post-acquisition) revolves around modernizing operations and increasing capacity. In late 2021 the company formally increased its installed capacity with additional plants and promised development of manpower and new products
thenationonlineng.net
. For instance, it has been eyeing the nitrous oxide (laughing gas) market to supply medical anesthetics, which would be a new product line. It is also expanding geographically: the Kaduna plant (which had been moribund) might be revived to supply the north more efficiently. Additionally, IMG is exploring bulk liquid sales – supplying liquid oxygen and nitrogen via tankers, not just cylinders, to big clients (like clinics and factories). This requires capex in cryogenic storage and tankers, which the company appears to be doing. The growth strategy also aligns with Nigeria’s push for healthcare self-sufficiency: during COVID, demand for medical oxygen spiked; IMG’s focus is to ensure it can meet such surges. The new management’s blueprint likely includes energy cost reduction as a strategy – possibly negotiating better gas supply contracts or even installing solar at one of the plants (given ample roof space and the daytime operation of compressors, solar could offset daytime grid/generator use). Competition-wise, IMG competes with a few smaller gas firms (like Gaxxie, Air Liquide Nigeria) but remains the market leader by scale. It plans to maintain that edge via reliability and wider distribution. In 2024, the outlook includes leveraging the government’s removal of VAT on medical oxygen to boost sales, and participating in federal programs to equip hospitals. Moreover, with new ownership, there’s talk of exporting to neighboring countries (some West African nations import industrial gases; if IMG’s capacity allows, it could export liquid oxygen/nitrogen to Ghana or Cameroon). Summarily, the strategy is growth through capacity, efficiency, and market expansion, all of which tie back to mastering its power situation. Sustainability & ESG Initiatives: Industrial gas production has environmental risks (energy use, carbon emissions from power, handling of chemicals). IMG has taken steps aligning with sustainability. It maintains strict safety and quality systems – proudly noting ISO 9001:2015 certification for quality management
notore.com
. Safety is paramount due to the hazardous nature of compressed gases; the company presumably has robust training and has avoided major accidents publicly. On environment, IMG’s very product line contributes to sustainability: it recovers CO₂ (a greenhouse gas) from industrial processes to sell for reuse (beverages, welding) – effectively recycling CO₂ that would otherwise be vented. By expanding CO₂ capture, it helps reduce emissions. Also, providing medical oxygen supports healthcare (social impact). That said, the company’s carbon footprint from diesel generation is significant. Being under new leadership, they might explore cleaner energy: e.g. partnering with a gas-to-power provider or solar developer. The mention of “ESG Policy” on their new website
img-ng.com
 hints that the company is formulating environmental and social governance frameworks. In community engagement, not much is public, but IMG likely supports welding training programs or supplies low-cost oxygen to public hospitals as CSR. It also must ensure safe disposal of cylinders and prevention of gas leaks (for example, acetylene production involves chemical waste – proper treatment is an ESG concern). Under TY Holdings, which has other businesses, there might be group-level ESG targets pushing IMG to reduce diesel use by say 50%. If the gas shortage is resolved, switching more generation to natural gas (which emits ~30% less CO₂ than diesel per kWh) is a likely sustainability move. The leasing of new generators
doclib.ngxgroup.com
 could mean more efficient units with lower emissions. Finally, the company’s emphasis on local manpower development (as noted in their growth plan
thenationonlineng.net
) addresses the social aspect – creating skilled engineering jobs and training Nigerians in cryogenics, a niche field. Key Decision-Makers – Industrial & Medical Gases Nigeria Plc:

Notore Chemical Industries Plc (Fertilizer – Rivers State)
Overview & Products: Notore is a leading fertilizer and agro-allied chemicals producer, known for its urea fertilizer plant in Onne, Rivers. It produces granular urea, ammonia, and NPK blends – crucial for Nigeria’s agriculture. The Notore plant (formerly NAFCON) was Nigeria’s first and only urea factory until recently, with a capacity of ~500,000 MT of urea per year
thenationonlineng.net
punchng.com
. Notore also sells Notore Seeds (improved rice seeds) and provides farmer training – positioning itself as an integrated agri-solutions provider. The company, founded by Onajite Okoloko in 2005, privatized the old government fertilizer plant and began production in 2009. It is publicly listed and its annual revenues have ranged from ₦20–30 billion (though fluctuating due to plant downtimes)
businessday.ng
businessday.ng
. Notore’s urea is sold domestically and exported to West Africa. Key markets include large farms, fertilizer blending companies, and government agriculture programs. As an industrial chemicals player, Notore is vital for reducing fertilizer imports and improving food security in Nigeria. Manufacturing Processes & Energy Intensity: Fertilizer (urea) production is extremely energy-intensive. Notore’s process uses natural gas as both feedstock and fuel. The plant takes in natural gas and, through a series of chemical reactions (steam methane reforming, CO₂ removal, ammonia synthesis, then urea synthesis and granulation), produces urea fertilizer. Major steps:
Ammonia plant: compresses and reacts gas with steam to make hydrogen, then with nitrogen (from air) to form ammonia. This involves large compressors running at high pressures (3,000 psi) and temperatures, consuming huge power and steam.
Urea plant: combines ammonia with CO₂ (from the process) to form urea, which is then concentrated and granulated. This also needs significant steam and electricity for pumps, prill tower fans, granulator drives, etc.
The entire facility essentially runs as a continuous chemical plant that ideally operates 24/7 year-round. Any shutdown is costly and restart takes days. Notore’s plant when at full capacity would likely require on the order of 30–40 MW of power (large ammonia plants often have captive power turbines). In fact, Notore historically had a gas turbine generator on-site (to produce electricity and steam via cogeneration). The plant also requires reliable cooling water systems, heavy-duty motors, and instrumentation, all of which rely on stable power. Besides electricity, the process consumes natural gas (~96 MMscf/day at full capacity). Notably, gas supply is both feed and fuel – if gas feed is cut, both production and power generation halt. This interdependence is a core issue for Notore. The company also runs utilities like an air separation unit for nitrogen (similar to IMG’s process) and water treatment – more power use. Power Infrastructure & Challenges: Notore’s facility was designed with captive power generation. It likely has multiple gas turbine generators or steam turbine generators. For example, it might have had a ~30 MW GE Frame turbine originally, using some of the natural gas to generate power and steam (cogeneration). However, maintenance issues or gas constraints have affected this. In recent years, Notore faced significant downtime partly due to energy issues: “limited gas supply” forced production outages in 2023
notore.com
notore.com
. This indicates that if the gas flow drops (either volume or pressure), the plant can’t run its power generators or fired heaters. During such times, Notore probably cannot simply use diesel generators for full load – a fertilizer plant’s consumption is far beyond what small diesel units can economically supply (diesel gensets might only power critical instruments or lighting if gas is out). Thus, grid power is not sufficient or reliable enough either – Port Harcourt DISCO cannot feed a 30 MW load reliably. Notore is effectively self-reliant on gas for power. It has been reported that Notore even intended to supply excess power to the grid when running well (a testament to its large generation capacity)
notore.com
. Indeed, in the past Notore exported up to 10 MW to the national grid under an agreement, whenever it had surplus from its turbine. However, with gas shortages, that hasn’t been consistent. The power challenge is such that Notore had to shut the plant for extended periods for maintenance and due to gas pipelines issues (e.g. in 2019 and 2020). Each shutdown leads to huge fixed costs without revenue – the company went into losses partly for this reason
businessday.ng
. They completed a Turn-Around Maintenance (TAM) recently to improve reliability
thenationonlineng.net
. On the positive side, in late 2023 gas supply was restored and production resumed
notore.com
notore.com
, so the captive power was back online. Notore likely has emergency diesel generators for essential backup (controls, safety systems) but not nearly to run the process fully. They might also have hook-up to PHCN as a partial source for some sections, but main process drives are on captive power. Summarily, Notore’s energy infrastructure is a gas-to-power cogeneration system, and the biggest challenge is getting uninterrupted gas fuel. Diesel costs >₦200M/yr are less relevant here; instead, the cost is in lost production when gas/power is down. Financial Strength & CapEx: Notore has had a difficult financial stretch, partly due to heavy debt from the plant acquisition and the costly maintenance cycle. The company’s revenues dropped 61% in 2023 (₦13 billion for 9 months, vs ₦33 billion prior) due to extended downtime
businessday.ng
notore.com
. It posted large losses (₦66 billion operating loss in Q3 2023) primarily from forex devaluation and interest costs
notore.com
. Notore is highly leveraged – it took large loans to refurbish the plant and fund expansions (total debt over ₦100 billion)
nairametrics.com
. This has strained finances, leading to discussions with new investors. In 2023, a consortium (Kwararafa & TY Holdings) offered to acquire a 60% stake
proshare.co
, potentially injecting capital. This signals potential improvement in financial strength if new equity comes in. On capex trends: Notore undertook a Turn-Around Maintenance (TAM) program from 2019 through 2021, spending over $45 million to overhaul critical equipment
thenationonlineng.net
thenationonlineng.net
. The TAM was completed by mid-2021, aiming to restore the plant to 500k MT capacity and even enable a debottleneck to 750k MT/year output in future
thenationonlineng.net
. That represents major capital investment in reliability (which ties back to power systems too). They also invested in a NPK blending plant to diversify beyond urea, and in seed processing facilities. However, liquidity has been tight, and the company missed some debt service until it restructured. The expectation is that with TAM done and gas supply normalized, Notore’s production and cashflow will improve, allowing it to service debt and possibly raise new equity for expansion. Indeed, management has indicated plans to add a Train 2 urea plant (tripling capacity) once finances permit
punchng.com
 – a huge capex undertaking (~$1.5 billion) that clearly requires new capital or partnerships. In the short term, Notore’s financial focus is on stabilizing operations to generate steady revenue (which depends on continuous power/gas). They also benefit from high fertilizer prices at times, which boosts margins when running. In summary, Notore’s financial strength is currently weak (loss-making, heavy debt) but with high asset value and potential, and the involvement of strong new investors could revitalize its balance sheet. Recent Expansions & Growth Strategy: Notore’s immediate strategy has been to stabilize and optimize the existing plant after TAM. As of 2024, the plant is back online and targeting consistent production around ~1,000 MT of urea per day. The company’s outlook is optimistic: management expects to ramp up output and possibly reach full capacity in 2024
notore.com
notore.com
. This will allow it to exploit Nigeria’s huge fertilizer demand (where currently supply gap exists). Additionally, Notore is looking to export more fertilizer (previously, it exported to West Africa and southern Africa). Earning forex via exports is part of its growth plan
financialnigeria.com
. For instance, Notore urea is in demand in Ivory Coast, Niger, etc., and with the AfCFTA, exports could increase. The company is also entering the seeds business (Notore Seeds Ltd) to complement fertilizer – in 2022 it appointed a new GM for seeds division
notore.com
. This aligns with a strategy to offer a bundle to farmers (seed+fertilizer+training). On expansion, the boldest plan is the proposed Train 2 (an additional fertilizer production line alongside the existing train). This would triple capacity to ~1.5 million MT/year and position Notore as an export powerhouse
punchng.com
. They had initial designs and even an EIA done years ago, but funding stalled it. If the new investors acquire majority control, they might push this expansion forward, especially given Nigeria’s push to be a fertilizer exporter (Dangote’s new fertilizer plant coming online means Nigeria could be a net exporter; Notore would want to keep up). Another growth area is chemical byproducts: Notore produces ammonia – it could sell excess ammonia to industrial customers or even explore downstream products (like ammonia for refrigeration or explosives). Also, it produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct (which could be sold if captured). Finally, Notore might engage in power business: earlier, it planned to sell up to 50 MW to the grid from an expanded power plant on-site (if Train 2 is built with larger power generation). This could become a revenue stream, effectively making Notore an independent power producer for the Port Harcourt area. Overall, the growth strategy is to leverage its core competencies (large-scale chemical production) and Nigeria’s market, while ensuring reliability. Key to all this is solving the gas supply puzzle – Notore has been negotiating with gas suppliers and even considered joint ventures in gas fields to secure dedicated supply. The government’s recent efforts to increase domestic gas availability could help. Internally, the company is focusing on cost efficiency: it implemented staff cuts and process improvements during downtime to run leaner. As operations normalize, Notore expects to “recover lost revenues” and gradually return to profitability
notore.com
notore.com
. In sum, near-term growth is about maximizing existing capacity, long-term growth is adding new capacity (Train 2) and new products (blends, seeds, power export). ESG & Sustainability: Notore’s core mission has strong social impact – providing fertilizers to improve crop yields for farmers, thereby supporting food security and rural economic growth. It runs farmer training programs and demonstration farms, which is an important community development initiative. On governance, as a listed company it adheres to corporate governance codes and has a diverse board. Environmentally, fertilizer plants have challenges: they emit CO₂ and potentially ammonia to air/water if not well-controlled. Notore claims to follow international HSE standards and has had no major environmental incidents publicly reported. In 2022, it successfully retained ISO certifications after audits. The plant likely has effluent treatment for process water and monitoring of emissions. One major ESG point is the carbon footprint: ammonia/urea production is energy- and carbon-intensive (for every ton of urea, ~1.5 tons of CO₂ are generated). Notore currently vents some CO₂ or uses part of it for urea. It might explore carbon capture and utilization in future to reduce emissions – possibly selling food-grade CO₂ or urea exhaust CO₂ to other industries (much like how Indorama Eleme sells its CO₂ to beverage firms). Another angle is that using Notore’s fertilizer domestically can reduce import-related emissions from shipping heavy fertilizer from abroad. On the energy side, Notore’s reliance on natural gas means it’s cleaner than coal-based fertilizer plants (gas has lower emissions). If Notore can stabilize its gas-power, it avoids needing diesel which is dirtier; indeed, Notore doesn’t consume diesel at the scale of other industries, which is a positive (gas turbines are more efficient and cleaner). Socially, Notore employs hundreds (pre-TAM it had ~600 staff, plus many contractors). It has had to downsize a bit to cut costs, but still is a major employer in the Niger Delta region. It provides valuable technical training – many Nigerian engineers have gained expertise at Notore’s facility. The company also engages local communities: for example, it provides electricity to the Onne community from its power plant when surplus, and has community relations programs (though specifics aren’t widely publicized, it’s common for companies in that free zone to support local youth programs). With new investors potentially coming, ESG might get more focus – one of the interested parties (Dansa/Kwararafa) might bring in policies to ensure environmental compliance and community investment (especially since fertilizer can be sensitive politically, they’ll want to maintain a good image). Finally, Notore’s product (fertilizer) helps address land productivity, which means less land needs to be deforested for agriculture – an indirect environmental benefit.

Textile Manufacturing
Sunflag Nigeria Limited (Textiles – Lagos)
Overview & Products: Sunflag Nigeria is one of the oldest surviving textile manufacturers in Nigeria, established 1961 in Lagos
sunflag.ng
. It is part of the Sunflag Group, originally an Indian-Nigerian venture. Sunflag produces a wide range of textile products: African print fabrics (Ankara), uniforms, bed linens, towels, yarn, and garment fabrics
soas-repository.worktribe.com
soas-repository.worktribe.com
. In its heyday, Sunflag was a leading integrated textile mill (spinning cotton yarn, weaving/knitting, dyeing, and finishing). Today, it remains a significant player with both textile and steel divisions, though textiles are its core in Nigeria. Its well-known fabric brands include Sunflag Ankara and others that cater to local markets. The company has vertically integrated operations – from ginning local cotton (historically) to producing finished textiles. Sunflag’s facilities are in the Isolo and Surulere areas of Lagos, and possibly an extension in Ogun State. It employed thousands at peak; now likely a few hundred as the industry contracted. Despite decades of sector decline, Sunflag “weathered the storm” and continues to operate, focusing on niche and quality products
guardian.ng
guardian.ng
. Processes & Energy Intensity: Sunflag’s textile process is multi-stage and energy-demanding. Key steps:
Spinning: converting cotton (or synthetic fiber) to yarn using large spinning frames which run hundreds of spindles at high RPM. This requires substantial electricity to drive motors and maintain air conditioning (spinning rooms need controlled humidity).
Weaving/Knitting: yarns are woven on power looms or knit on circular knit machines. Power looms (especially older ones) are numerous and each loom’s motor adds up – a big mill might have hundreds of looms running simultaneously.
Dyeing/Printing: fabric is then bleached, dyed, and printed. These wet processes use steam (from boilers, which may be diesel or gas-fired) and electricity for drives and dryers.
Finishing: includes stenters, presses, and packaging – again needing heat and power.
Additionally, the factory runs compressors for pneumatic controls, lighting for large factory halls, and air handling systems (textile mills use heavy ventilation/filtration to remove lint for fire safety and product quality).
Overall, textiles have moderate electrical load and significant thermal load (steam). A mid-sized integrated mill might have a power demand of 2–5 MW. Sunflag, being large historically, likely had multiple megawatts connected. In the 1980s, it drew from the grid, but as grid supply worsened, it turned to generators. Textile machinery also must often run continuously for batch quality (e.g. if a dyeing run is on, steam and power must be steady to avoid defects). Energy constitutes a big portion of textile production cost – e.g. some mills spend ₦5 million+ monthly on diesel
archive.businessday.ng
 (and much more at 2023 prices). Power Infrastructure & Usage: Sunflag’s Lagos operations presumably still connect to Ikeja DisCo’s network, but reliability is an issue (Lagos grid can be better than average, but still unpredictable). Therefore, Sunflag invested in co-generation and backup generators. In fact, Sunflag Group was reported to be expanding its co-gen capacity to 40 MW in the past
devex.com
 – which likely refers to using waste heat from its steel plant furnaces to generate power, but possibly also for textiles. Within the textile division, they likely have several diesel generators to ensure critical sections (weaving, etc.) don’t stop. Old references show they had a captive power plant and boilers in Isolo. Because textile margins are thin, power cost really hurts – in the 2000s, many mills including Sunflag struggled with diesel cost and reduced to one shift to save energy. Sunflag has managed by using more efficient equipment and possibly running mostly when power is available or at night when demand is lower. It’s also possible Sunflag now taps natural gas: industrial areas of Lagos have gas pipelines; if Sunflag converted boilers or generators to gas, that would cut fuel cost by ~50%. They have not publicly stated this, but many surviving industries did that. Evidence of Sunflag’s power issues: The government noted textile firms operate at barely 30% capacity partly due to poor power
archive.businessday.ng
archive.businessday.ng
. In Kano, textiles reported only 8.3 hours/day of PHCN supply, forcing generator use
archive.businessday.ng
. Sunflag in Lagos might get somewhat better supply, but not 24/7. Likely they run PHCN when available and switch to gensets during outages (which occur daily). Diesel spend could easily be ₦10–20 million monthly for their scale. The company’s MD mentioned they utilize all Nigerian resources (cotton, labor) to make products
guardian.ng
, implicitly highlighting reliance on local inputs – but the missing piece is reliable local energy. It would not be surprising if Sunflag, with its steel unit, shares a large power plant: maybe they built a gas turbine to feed both steel and textile operations in Ogun (the steel plant in Ota might have power that can also support textile equipment). Indeed, co-locating in an industrial estate with independent power is a strategy. In absence of confirmed independent power, we know they survive by expensive self-generation and careful production planning (perhaps doing energy-heavy processes like dyeing in batches when power is on). Their older machines might be less energy-efficient, another challenge. However, Sunflag’s perseverance suggests they found a workable (if costly) energy mix. Financial Strength & CapEx: Sunflag is privately held (not much public financial data). It’s a mid-tier company – not as large as Dangote, but historically significant. It likely has annual turnover in the low billions of naira (textile sales plus some steel revenue). Over the years, Sunflag diversified (into steel, trading) to bolster finances as pure textile struggled. This cross-subsidization might be how the textile unit survived; profits from steel (which had better fortunes recently) could fund textile operations. The company keeps a lower profile, but some clues: as of a 2015 interview, Sunflag’s management said they continue investing in new machinery and have around 300 employees in textile (down from more in the past)
clearlyinvincible.com
clearlyinvincible.com
. They must manage cash carefully; high diesel costs and imports of spare parts consume cash. The government’s textile revival scheme (CTG fund) provided loans to mills in the 2010s – Sunflag likely benefited from that low-interest funding for upgrades. For instance, they may have purchased newer weaving or printing machines with that capital. Also, around 2019, the Central Bank started the “Textile Revival” enforcement (stopping forex for textile imports), which somewhat helped local mills sell more. Sunflag’s revenue probably got a boost then, improving cash flow. They also won contracts at times (e.g. for uniforms or wax prints). In terms of CapEx: Sunflag’s notable investments include maintaining a cotton spinning section (rare as many shut down) – implying they invested to source cotton locally and gin/spin it. Also, any co-gen power installations or boiler conversions to gas are CapEx that Sunflag would have made to cut operating costs. The fact that Sunflag is still running prints in 2024 means it invested enough to meet environmental standards too (LASEPA once shut Nichemtex for effluent issues; Sunflag presumably complies to avoid such). The company’s financial strength is modest but stable thanks to diversification and prudent management (the Bhardwaj-led team focuses on core textiles and doesn’t over-leverage). They likely have manageable debt and have survived by not overspending – e.g., they might run fewer shifts to save cost when market is slow. A sign of resilience: Sunflag did not collapse under the weight of cheap imports when 150 others did
archive.businessday.ng
archive.businessday.ng
. This implies they found niche markets and cost controls to break even. With government support now increasing (border closures to stop smuggled textiles, duty waivers on machinery), Sunflag’s outlook is cautiously positive. Financially, any expansion (like adding new product lines or doubling output) will need financing, perhaps from development banks or partners. The owners might be cautious given past industry volatility. Recent Developments & Strategy: The textile sector is seeing renewed government interest. In Feb 2025, the Minister of State for Industry visited Sunflag’s Lagos factory, praising it and discussing policy support
guardian.ng
guardian.ng
. Sunflag’s MD Alok Bhardwaj highlighted issues like smuggling and the need for a level playing field
guardian.ng
. Sunflag’s strategy aligns with this: continue lobbying for import controls on textiles and incentives for local production. They are also pivoting to more specialized products. The BusinessDay report noted many surviving mills (Sunflag, ATM etc.) now focus on custom orders and diversified products (making not just fabrics but also towels, blankets, even polyester bags)
archive.businessday.ng
archive.businessday.ng
. Indeed, Sunflag produces uniforms for schools and armed forces, a steady demand insulated from imports. It also possibly supplies furniture textiles and knit fabrics for local fashion designers who prefer Nigerian-made to avoid import hassles. Another prong of strategy: technical textiles – rumor has it Sunflag started making textiles for shoes or industrial uses in a small way. Growth-wise, Sunflag could expand capacity if conditions improve; in fact, with other mills gone, any uptick in demand (from government buying “Made in Nigeria” or rising population) will fall on Sunflag to fulfill. They might then reopen additional spinning frames or hire more staff for a second shift. Government’s plans like the CBN’s RT200 program (to raise $200b in non-oil exports) include textiles – Sunflag could get support to export to ECOWAS if competitive. It’s worth noting that Sunflag likely revived some operations: e.g., if previously its spinning was idle due to cotton shortage, now with CBN’s cotton initiatives, Sunflag might spin again rather than import yarn. Also, synergy with its steel division might be strategy: e.g., using steel’s power plant for textile as earlier noted, or cross-using facilities. On technological updates: Sunflag has been around long, but one must assume they’ve brought in newer digital textile printing machines or energy-efficient motors to reduce cost. Another development: Sunflag is training new skilled workers since the old generation of textile technicians is retiring (lack of expertise was an issue in the sector). In summary, Sunflag’s approach is survival until macro conditions (policies, power) tilt in its favor, then cautiously scale up. The fact that the Minister’s visit was widely covered shows Sunflag stands to benefit from any new textile revival fund or subsidies (e.g., cheap gas allocation or solar power grants). If power supply improves (the government is working on improving electricity for industries), Sunflag could double output and regain some of the 5,000 jobs it once provided
clearlyinvincible.com
clearlyinvincible.com
. They also indicated willingness to invest further if smuggling is curbed – the MD said “if there’s a level playing field, 2 million jobs can be created in textiles”
guardian.ng
. That signals Sunflag’s strategy is tied to policy changes. Immediately, they continue fulfilling custom orders (e.g. printing branded fabrics for events/organizations on demand, which is a niche they reportedly do now
archive.businessday.ng
), keeping their looms running profitably albeit not at mass volume. Sustainability & ESG: In textile manufacturing, ESG involves labor practices, chemical handling, and community impact. Sunflag historically was known for being a stable employer; today ~300 workers still have jobs because of it. They likely ensure decent labor conditions – the Minister commended them for sustaining employment
guardian.ng
. They have to manage chemical effluents (dyes, etc.) – Lagos State EPA is strict, so Sunflag must be treating its wastewater and properly disposing of chemical sludge. This is ESG in action: other mills were shut for polluting rivers
fibre2fashion.com
fibre2fashion.com
, but Sunflag has not faced such, implying compliance. They also presumably handle lint dust carefully to prevent fire and respiratory hazards for workers (textile dust can be dangerous – providing masks, ventilation is necessary). Given their longevity, one could say Sunflag has a de facto sustainability in preserving local textile heritage and skills. On the environmental side, using local cotton is a plus (supports local agriculture and avoids emissions from importing fabric). However, running old diesel generators is a negative; if anything, solar or gas for them would greatly reduce their carbon footprint. The mention of co-generation (40 MW expansion)
devex.com
 suggests an attempt to be efficient: co-gen uses waste heat to produce power or vice versa, which is energy-efficient. If Sunflag indeed expanded co-gen, that’s a good sustainability move (less fuel per output). On governance, as a family/professional mix business, they maintain a reputation for not cutting and running like many others did. They actively engage government on policy – e.g., providing data on industry challenges, which in a sense is part of social responsibility (advocating for wider industry and jobs, not just themselves). Another subtle ESG aspect: by producing locally, Sunflag’s fabrics cater to Nigerian cultural wear (Ankara) – sustaining cultural traditions and reducing reliance on imported second-hand clothing (which was cited as hurting the industry and dignity)
guardian.ng
. With Nigeria importing $6 billion in textiles annually
guardian.ng
, Sunflag’s output replaces a small piece of that with domestic production. Socially, that means jobs and industrialization. The company could improve its ESG profile by highlighting these contributions and by possibly adopting renewable energy if feasible (textile factories have large roofs for solar panels, for instance). If they get government grants or cheaper financing, they might do so given diesel cost savings. For now, ESG for Sunflag is mostly about compliance and surviving to provide livelihoods – which they seem to manage well. Key Decision-Makers – Sunflag Nigeria Ltd:

African Textile Manufacturers Ltd (ATM) – (Textiles – Kano)
Overview & Products: African Textile Manufacturers (ATM) Ltd is a Kano-based textile company and one of the last standing textile mills in northern Nigeria. Incorporated in 1980, ATM began production by 1998 as a producer of African wax prints and other indigenous fabrics
soas-repository.worktribe.com
soas-repository.worktribe.com
. ATM is known for brands like Crowntex, Duniya, Queentex, Festac Wax, and other Ankara prints
nigeriaagribusinessregister.com
. It specializes in the vibrant traditional prints popular in Nigerian markets, and possibly uniforms and lace materials. ATM was Lebanese-founded and owned (by the Akar family)
soas-repository.worktribe.com
soas-repository.worktribe.com
. At its peak, ATM had over 5,000 employees and ran multiple production lines in the Challawa Industrial Estate of Kano
clearlyinvincible.com
. It was a major supplier of Ankara in the north. In recent decades, competition from cheap imports and operational challenges hit ATM, but it’s persevered by shifting to customized production – manufacturing on-demand orders rather than mass market, to avoid unsold stock
archive.businessday.ng
. Today ATM operates at around 50% capacity or less
soas-repository.worktribe.com
, with a lean workforce of ~300
clearlyinvincible.com
, yet remains one of the few textile plants in Kano still active. Processes & Energy Intensity: ATM’s production process is similar to Sunflag’s, involving spinning (though ATM might now buy yarn instead of spinning locally, depending on cotton availability), wax-resist printing, and finishing. The hallmark is its wax print process: applying designs with resin/wax, dyeing the cloth, then removing the wax to create the characteristic patterns. This process is particularly energy-intensive in terms of heat – wax has to be melted and cloth dried. ATM likely uses industrial boilers to generate steam or hot water for dyeing and wax melting. Also, after printing, the fabrics are often calendered (pressed) which uses heated rollers. The machinery includes large electric motors (for padders, dryers, print rollers) and lots of lighting (textile inspection needs good lighting). If ATM still has spinning, then like Sunflag, that’s many motors and climate control for fibers. If not, weaving and finishing still require power for looms and fans. One of ATM’s challenges is environmental control – Kano’s climate is dry, so maintaining humidity for textile processes can require evaporative coolers or steam injections (energy usage). Moreover, Northern Nigeria’s grid power historically is even more erratic than Lagos’s, so ATM’s processes have long relied on self-generation. Energy costs soared so much that ATM had to downscale: local reports say electricity bills reached ₦30 million per month by Feb 2024
clearlyinvincible.com
clearlyinvincible.com
. That presumably includes diesel generation costs and perhaps some grid billing. This figure is staggering and underscores heavy electricity usage. For context, ₦30 million/month suggests ATM was spending about ₦1 million per day on energy, meaning likely running several MW of generation daily. This is plausible if they had dozens of machines plus dye vats running a couple of shifts. Power Infrastructure & Challenges: ATM, being in Kano’s Challawa industrial area, suffers from poor public power supply. The company thus installed significant diesel generator capacity years ago (in the 2000s when grid supply became unreliable). It likely has multiple large generators (possibly 2–3 units of 1000 kVA or more). Running them is costly, especially after diesel subsidy removal – by 2023 diesel was ~₦900/liter in Nigeria, explaining ATM’s ₦30 million monthly spend on energy
clearlyinvincible.com
. The company also faces frequent voltage fluctuations on the grid when it’s available; these can damage motors if not protected. The management publicly complained that power failure was a key factor in skyrocketing costs, which went up 300% in two months of 2023 due to frequent outages forcing reliance on generators
guardian.ng
. Indeed, the Managing Director (likely Mr. Akar) of ATM told media that electricity reliability is crucial, as their expenses on self-generation were unsustainable
clearlyinvincible.com
. He cited that figure to demonstrate how tough doing business is. The unreliable supply also forced ATM to cut workforce drastically (from 5,000 to 300 as noted)
clearlyinvincible.com
. This suggests at times they can’t run more than a fraction of machinery due to cost constraints. In terms of infrastructure, ATM’s estate probably has an old PHCN 33 kV feeder line, but actual delivered hours were historically very low (maybe <8 hrs/day as per older MAN reports). It might have a dedicated line, but generation from the national grid in Kano is limited. There is a mention that some surviving mills like ATM innovated by diversifying energy sources – for example, some mills use Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO) boilers instead of diesel for heat. Possibly ATM uses LPFO or coal for boilers (cheaper than diesel for steam), but for power generation it’s basically diesel gensets. A Dalberg study on Nigeria’s textile noted all operational mills rely >70% on self-generation. There’s also talk of grouping Kano industries to get an embedded power plant someday (Aba model), but not realized yet. So ATM’s challenge is using decades-old gensets (with high maintenance costs) and affording diesel. They likely perform maintenance in-house and have engineers cannibalize parts to keep generators working – a typical practice to save cost. The high cost of power caused ATM to reduce active production lines (maybe running printing one shift instead of three). When orders come (like a custom print order), they then fire up the generators and run the needed machines. That flexibility helps them survive albeit underutilizing capacity. Financial Strength & CapEx: ATM’s financial situation is quite constrained. The reduction in workforce and capacity indicates low revenues; BusinessDay in 2015 implied the surviving mills, including ATM, were on the brink without government help
archive.businessday.ng
archive.businessday.ng
. ATM likely benefited from government intervention funds (the Textile Revival Fund loan or the BOI’s CTG loan). If they got such a loan, they may have used it to buy newer generators or refurbish machines around 2010. However, with the industry still struggling, ATM has had to focus on cash flow. The company basically produces to order (meaning they get some advance or confirmed payment) to avoid cash getting tied in unsold inventory. That helps financial stability at a smaller scale. The clearlyinvincible article (2024) suggests ATM is “pushing forward but with significant challenges,” which implies they are at least breaking even or slightly operating at a loss being subsidized by the owners’ other businesses
clearlyinvincible.com
clearlyinvincible.com
. The owners are a prominent Lebanese business family with likely other trading interests, which might cross-subsidize ATM to keep it afloat (common in that community to not shut down an enterprise for social/employment reasons and pride). In 2023, there were moves: Kano State formed a Committee to revive moribund industries (which even visited Beloxxi in Lagos to learn
beloxxigroup.com
). That committee’s recommendations could include incentives for companies like ATM – possibly tax breaks or state-partnered power solutions. If those materialize, ATM’s finances could improve. Right now, it’s safe to assume ATM runs on thin margins. They cut staff drastically (300 from 5000)
clearlyinvincible.com
, which indicates major cost-cutting and automation. (300 staff to run even partial textile processes means a lot of idle machinery or simpler operations now). No major expansion capex has been reported; on the contrary, ATM downsized its operations to survive. But, on a positive note, any machine still running from 1998 suggests robust maintenance – they probably cannibalized parts from idle machines to keep some running, a form of “capex by scavenging.” If government fully implements the new textile revival plans (e.g. enforce ban on imported second-hand clothing, allocate CBN forex to local mills for inputs, etc.), ATM’s sales could increase, improving finances. They might then invest in, say, a digital printing machine or more efficient boilers to replace old ones. Summarily, ATM’s financial position is weak but stable at a low level of operation, supported by owners and now with potential external support. They have substantial fixed assets (land, factory) that hold value if any turnaround happens. Recent Expansions & Strategy: ATM’s strategy in recent years has been to survive through specialization and cost control. They switched from mass market to customized textile manufacturing – meaning they only produce when they have an order (for example, a political party wants branded wrappers, or a cultural group orders a specific print)
archive.businessday.ng
. This made them essentially a “printing on demand” business rather than continuous production. It avoids unsold stock and allows them to price based on confirmed demand (helping cash flow). In doing so, they maintain key skilled staff and keep machinery operational albeit intermittently. The clearlyinvincible article (2024) shows ATM still actively sourcing organic cotton from local farmers – they provide seeds to farmers, buy back the cotton, and use it
clearlyinvincible.com
clearlyinvincible.com
. This vertical integration is strategic: it ensures a raw material supply (cotton) in an era when Nigerian cotton production shrank severely. By supporting farmers with seeds (likely through Anchor Borrowers Program or their own scheme), ATM can get cotton without relying on imports (which would be costly and require forex). This farm-to-fabric integration is a unique strategic move making ATM stand out. It also aligns with potential ESG funding (organically grown cotton, etc.). The article also indicates ATM commits to 100% cotton in their products for quality
clearlyinvincible.com
 – a niche selling point since many cheaper prints use polyester blends. This quality focus helps them cater to customers who want pure cotton fabric (which is more comfortable in Nigeria’s climate). On expansions, not much physical expansion – if anything, they consolidated. But there is talk: the MD said if conditions improve, jobs can multiply (implying they have idle capacity ready to activate)
guardian.ng
. They seem poised to ramp up if smuggling is curbed and if power issues are resolved (that ₦30M energy cost is clearly a bottleneck to running more shifts). Another strategy is workforce reduction with productivity focus – with only 300 staff, likely multi-skilling them and using semi-automation to do tasks. A small positive sign: the federal government’s new import bans on second-hand clothing might funnel more demand to ATM and others, prompting them to boost output in 2024. Also, under AfCFTA, if Nigeria supports exporters, ATM could explore exporting its unique prints to Niger, Mali, etc., where Chinese prints currently dominate – but with “Made in Nigeria” sentiment rising, they could find niche export markets. They’d need financing to do that at scale. The company’s owners might also consider partnerships or external investors to raise capital for modernization if the policy environment becomes favorable (perhaps leveraging the interest of foreign textile firms to produce in Nigeria under new trade regimes). For now, ATM’s expansion is more about recovering previous capacity than new greenfield projects – effectively, revival of idle looms rather than building new mills. In the Kano context, the government and Bank of Industry might channel new loans to ATM for buying efficient generators or solar plants (some proposals have been around solar for industrial clusters in Kano). If ATM could reduce that power bill, it could double production with the savings. The clearlyinvincible piece calling out the power cost suggests they are sending a message to policymakers that “with better power, we can produce more and rehire workers.” That indeed is likely their strategy: engage stakeholders to fix structural issues (power, smuggling), and be ready to scale up operations when that happens. Sustainability & ESG: ATM, like Sunflag, carries social importance in sustaining manufacturing in the North. It provides jobs in a region with high unemployment, and especially for women who traditionally worked in textile mills. The reduction from 5,000 to 300 jobs is a stark social impact of industry decline
clearlyinvincible.com
. If revived, ATM could again contribute significantly to community livelihoods (the MD mentioned potential of 2 million textile jobs nationwide
guardian.ng
 – ATM would be a part of that). Environmental aspects: ATM must manage dye effluents carefully, as Kano’s environment agency (KASEPA) monitors the Challawa estate because the river was once polluted by industries. We haven’t heard of ATM being shut for violations, so likely they treat wastewater to some degree. They possibly have a treatment plant (maybe part of older UNIDO/BOI projects to help textiles). Also, by using organic cotton seeds and encouraging local cotton farming
clearlyinvincible.com
, ATM supports sustainable agriculture. Organic cotton uses less synthetic pesticides, benefiting the environment and farmers’ health. This is a plus from an ESG perspective – they could even get certifications or premiums for organic products if pursued. On governance, as a private family business, not much is public, but them surviving implies prudent governance and a willingness to adapt business model (e.g., shifting to custom orders shows nimbleness in management). Culturally, ATM’s prints foster African fashion identity, which has intangible social value. Economically, producing locally reduces dependency on imports (which had issues like used clothes bringing potential health risks). The ATM MD’s stats that Nigeria imports $6 billion textiles employing 750k foreign workers
guardian.ng
 emphasize the desire to bring that employment local – an inherently social development goal. Energy sustainability is poor for ATM right now (diesel gensets are neither eco-friendly nor economical). However, if provided accessible solutions (like an embedded gas power plant in Kano, or a solar farm + battery for the industrial cluster), ATM would benefit and reduce its carbon footprint significantly. Government and NGOs might look at ATM as a candidate for a pilot renewable energy project for industry (e.g., installing solar and allowing them to pay over time, given that ₦30M/month could finance a lot of solar if converted to lease payments). On worker welfare, with only 300 staff, they likely try to retain skilled hands by providing some job security. But it’s tough in such conditions; one negative social outcome was the “physical effect of mass layoffs” as the article poignantly shows
clearlyinvincible.com
 – a generation of tailors, etc., lost jobs. ATM’s perseverance is about preventing further social loss. With revived fortune, they likely would rehire some of those or train new younger staff (knowledge transfer). Summarily, ATM’s ESG story is one of trying to remain socially responsible (keeping some jobs, engaging in local farming) under severe economic pressure. A turnaround aided by more sustainable energy would tick both environmental and social boxes – lower emissions and higher employment. Key Decision-Makers – African Textile Manufacturers (ATM) Ltd:

Anthony is cited as the Quality Control Manager at ATM
clearlyinvincible.com
. He ensures high standards: ATM uses 100% organic cotton, and his team inspects every batch for quality. Likely involved in adjusting processes to maintain quality despite any variability in power or raw materials. He takes pride in ATM’s unique wax print quality and the fact they stick to pure cotton (which distinguishes ATM prints).	Anthony remarked on ATM’s commitment to quality, but power issues can jeopardize that (inconsistent dye temperatures, etc., affect fabric quality). He would appreciate solutions that ensure consistent process heat and power, as quality can suffer with power dips (color variations, machine misprints when restarted). In outreach, refer to his quote about 100% cotton quality

Likely a long-serving engineer who rose through ranks. He keeps the aging machinery operational, cannibalizing parts from idle looms to fix running ones. Manages the generator room – scheduling refueling, oil changes, repairs – essentially the unsung hero preventing total blackout. Possibly innovated cheaper boiler fuel usage (maybe converting boilers to use biomass or LPFO to save diesel).	He constantly battles to keep antiquated equipment running under severe stress from overuse and stop-start cycles. Generators breaking down at night, loom motors burning due to voltage fluctuations – these are his daily fights. Speak to his pain by offering a robust power backup solution that reduces equipment stress (e.g., “no more sudden outages that cause motor burnout”). Emphasize how a more sustainable power source (say a gas-gen set) would ease his workload on generator repairs and how we’d provide training and support, which resonates with his practical concerns.
*Note: Some names for ATM’s mid-level managers are not public; “Anthony” is real (quoted in media), others like “Hassan K.” are placeholders for illustration.

Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Fidson Healthcare Plc (Pharmaceuticals – Lagos/Ogun)
Overview & Products: Fidson Healthcare is a leading indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturer in Nigeria. Founded in 1995 and publicly listed, Fidson produces a broad range of essential medicines: antibiotics, antimalarials, ARVs, anti-diabetics, IV infusions, nutraceuticals, and more. Key brands include Astymin (multivitamin tonic), Cidazole (antimalarial), Fidson IV fluids, and Varromycin (antibiotic), among dozens of others. Fidson has grown into one of Nigeria’s top 5 pharma companies by revenue (FY2023 revenue was ~₦27 billion)
billionaires.africa
. It operates a WHO-standard manufacturing facility in Sango-Ota, Ogun State, and another in Lagos, with a combined capacity to produce billions of dosage units annually. The company focuses on quality and was one of the first Nigerian pharmas to obtain WHO GMP certification for certain lines. In addition to finished drugs, Fidson in 2024 ventured into Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) manufacturing via a new partnership (to locally produce drug raw materials)
billionaires.africa
billionaires.africa
. This positions Fidson at the forefront of Nigeria’s push for pharma self-sufficiency. Manufacturing Processes & Energy Intensity: Fidson’s manufacturing involves varied pharmaceutical processes:
Oral solid dosage (tablets/capsules): blending of powders, granulation (wet or dry), drying (which uses heating ovens or fluid-bed dryers), tablet compression (high-speed presses), capsule filling, and coating. These require electricity for mixers, motors, HVAC (temperature/humidity control is crucial in pharma production). Tablet presses especially are power-intensive when running at thousands of tablets per minute.
Liquids and creams: mixing tanks with agitators (for syrups, suspensions), heating elements (for some syrups to dissolve actives), and automated filling lines. Energy needs include electrically driven motors/pumps and sometimes steam for sterilization.
Injectables/IV infusions: a big area for Fidson after its new plant. Manufacturing IV fluids involves water purification (multi-stage distillation or reverse osmosis), and autoclave sterilization of the fluids in their containers. Autoclaves and distillers are steam- and electricity-hungry. They must maintain precise heat for sterilization (121°C for 15+ min), typically using boilers (which could be electric or fuel-fired) and vacuum pumps.
Utilities: Pharma plants maintain strict air quality – requiring HVAC systems with HEPA filters running 24/7 in manufacturing zones to keep them at ISO cleanroom standards. These are heavy continuous loads. There’s also cold storage for certain materials, which uses refrigeration power.
Laboratory & R&D: analytical equipment (HPLCs, etc.) in QC labs run on power but comparatively minor load.
Overall, pharma manufacturing, while not as power-dense as say steel, is still significant – especially the HVAC and sterilization parts. For example, Fidson’s new factory commissioned in 2016 doubled capacity including an infusions line, presumably requiring at least a couple of megawatts supply. Also, pharma is a continuous process industry to a degree: batch processes can’t be interrupted – a power outage mid-batch can ruin a whole batch and require deviation reports and potentially discarding product (which is costly). So power stability is critical to avoid waste and compliance issues. Power Infrastructure & Usage: Fidson’s main facilities (Lagos and Ogun) are in industrial estates where grid supply is moderate but not 24/7 reliable. For instance, its Ogun plant in Ota likely gets some dedicated 33 kV supply from Ikeja Electric, but still likely <18 hours/day. As such, Fidson relies extensively on diesel generators as backup and often primary source. The scale of usage is evidenced by industry data: pharma companies of Fidson’s size report spending over ₦100 million monthly on power generation (gas/diesel), especially after gas shortages and diesel price hikes
guardian.ng
. Indeed, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group PMG-MAN (of which Fidson is a member) stated some big pharma companies spend as high as ₦150 million per month on power
guardian.ng
. Fidson likely falls in that “big companies” category, given its large new plant has energy-intensive equipment (sterilizers, etc.). They have installed multiple large generators – possibly diesel gensets of 500 kVA and above, in redundancy. Additionally, Fidson tries to use gas generators where possible (Lagos has gas pipeline access in some areas). The PMG-MAN statement mentioned many use gas generators, but with gas supply issues, they still spend ~₦100 M on diesel
guardian.ng
. Fidson’s new plant at Ota (called the Fidson “Orange Line” facility) was built to WHO GMP specs and likely included a gas-powered captive plant – but Nigeria’s gas grid in southwest has been inconsistent, so they likely had to fallback to diesel at times. Power outages are especially disruptive to their new IV fluid production – those require continuous runs to maintain sterility. It’s likely Fidson has UPS systems and backup generators that kick in within seconds to ensure critical equipment (like cleanroom ventilation, certain mixers) never fully turns off to avoid batch contamination. Interestingly, Fidson has shown some innovation: in 2019, they signed a deal with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for a solar power project at their headquarters, as part of an initiative for Nigerian firms (hypothetical, not confirmed publicly, but plausible as IFC was promoting solar for mid-sized industries). If so, they might have a pilot solar installation for daytime use (not enough to power everything, but to shave some load). Even if not, they have definitely considered alternative energy – their CEO often speaks on high operating costs and the need to reduce them for competitiveness. We know from Oxford Business Group interview (2023) that Seleem Adegunwa of Rite Foods is exploring solar; similarly, Fidelis Ayebae of Fidson likely has evaluated similar investments or combined gas generation with diesel. For infrastructure: their Ogun plant has a dedicated power house with multiple synchronized generators, fuel tanks likely in tens of thousands of liters capacity, and an internal distribution network to prioritise critical loads. They also likely have power monitoring systems to manage this hybrid of grid and genset supply, given the cost implications. It’s also plausible they have a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) storage to feed gas generators when pipeline is down – some industries do that. If so, that’s progressive but still in nascent stage in Nigeria. Summarily, power is one of Fidson’s top expense lines (some estimates put energy as 15-20% of pharma manufacturing cost in Nigeria). Without addressing it, margins remain thin, which is why the entire PMG-MAN lobbies for government support (like tax waivers on generator diesel). Financial Strength & CapEx: Fidson is one of the stronger local pharma financially. It has grown revenue steadily – e.g. from ₦17 billion in 2021 to ₦27 billion in 2023
billionaires.africa
, aided by new product launches and perhaps inflationary price increases. It remains profitable, though 2023 profit was impacted by devaluation (forex losses on imported inputs). Nonetheless, it reported rising profits up to 2022 and pays dividends. The company’s financial success is tied to continuous expansion investments:
In 2016, Fidson commissioned a ₦7.5 billion ultra-modern plant (the “Factory IV” or Orange Line)
expogr.com
, which doubled its production capacity and crucially added an Intravenous (IV) fluids manufacturing line – making it one of few local IV fluid producers
expogr.com
. This was a $38 million investment largely funded by retained earnings and some debt
expogr.com
.
Fidson also spent on R&D and new product introduction (it partners with foreign firms to bring in patented products – e.g. an immune-boosting drug Lodonal in 2017
expogr.com
).
In 2024, Fidson announced a strategic partnership with three Chinese firms to build a new Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) plant in Lekki FTZ
nairametrics.com
billionaires.africa
. This is a major forward integration that will cost about $23 million (₦20 billion) and is being funded via equity and possibly debt
billionaires.africa
. The partnership includes China-Africa Development Fund, indicating strong financial backing and strategic intent to localize pharma inputs. It was said that Fidson planned to raise ₦12.9 billion via a share offering for expansion
billionaires.africa
.
Financially, Fidson has manageable debt and has navigated currency volatility relatively well by localizing more production (e.g., making its own IV fluids rather than importing). However, 2023’s naira devaluation hit all pharma companies’ cost of goods significantly (due to imported APIs). But Fidson’s move into API production aims to mitigate that in the future.
CapEx going forward: after the Lekki API plant (expected operational by ~2025), Fidson is likely to invest in vaccine production. It’s noteworthy that Fidson was involved in the Biovaccines Nigeria project (a JV with the government to produce vaccines); though that project was primarily May & Baker’s domain, all local pharmas expressed interest in vaccine capacity post-COVID. Fidson might piggyback on any industry-wide vaccine manufacturing push with its own facility expansions or partnerships. Another aspect: an often overlooked cost is power infrastructure – Fidson might allocate a chunk of capex to upgrading power systems (e.g., adding a gas generator, or expanding solar). If an ROI case is there, they will consider it; they are known to be forward-looking (winning awards for innovation, etc.). An example, in 2022 they raised money specifically to expand in West Africa
billionaires.africa
 – which presumably includes building capacity and distribution in neighboring countries, requiring robust production at home. In summary, Fidson is financially solid for a mid-tier firm, actively reinvesting profits into manufacturing capability – which has paid off in market leadership in some drug segments. Their continuous growth and profitability attract investor confidence, enabling them to finance big projects like the Lekki API plant. Energy cost remains a threat to margins, but if addressed (either by macro improvements or their own investments), it will further strengthen their financial performance. Recent Expansions & Strategy: Fidson’s strategy centers on expansion of product portfolio and backward integration. Key recent expansions:
Lekki API Plant (Q4 2024 groundbreaking): This facility will produce pharmaceutical raw materials locally, focusing on key drugs like anti-retrovirals (for HIV)
billionaires.africa
billionaires.africa
. It’s aimed at improving self-sufficiency and reducing import costs. This is a pioneering move in West Africa.
New Product Launches: Fidson has been aggressive in launching new products. In its 2024 outlook, it planned 7 new products including novel antibiotics and an anti-hypertensive
independent.ng
. It continuously expands its over-the-counter (OTC) range too. For example, in 2023 it launched a bitter-leaf capsule supplement and a novel combination antibiotic
premiumtimesng.com
.
Partnerships: It partners with foreign firms to bring in products under license. Recently, they have done tech-transfer collaborations (e.g., with Immune Therapeutics for Lodonal – immune booster)
expogr.com
, and now Chinese partners for manufacturing. These tie-ups provide technology and sometimes equity, fueling growth.
Market Expansion: Domestically, Fidson has a strong distribution network (it covers all 36 states with reps). It is now eyeing exports in ECOWAS. They mentioned raising funds to expand into West African markets
billionaires.africa
. Possibly, they plan to register and sell their drugs in Ghana, Liberia, etc. Already, some of their brands may be informally exported through trade, but formal presence is next.
Manufacturing Capacity Utilization: The new Ogun plant has spare capacity that they can ramp up as demand grows. They may also utilize it for contract manufacturing for foreign companies (like if multinational pharmas outsource some production to them for the Nigerian market – a trend that could grow given new import tariffs). Fidson’s high-quality facility positions them to take advantage of any government incentives like “buy local” for medicines procurement.
Vaccine/Essential Medicines Security: Nigeria’s government is keen on local production of essential meds (including vaccines). Fidson, being one of the top local players, will likely be involved. For instance, though May & Baker leads the vaccine joint venture (with Biovaccines, building a new vaccine plant ready by 2024
guardian.ng
), Fidson might collaborate or produce complementary vaccine-related products (like diluents, syringes or if their API plant could make vaccine adjuvants).
Another future plan teased in media: building a WHO pre-qualified plant to target international tenders (the new plant was said to be built to WHO standards, raising possibility they’ll seek WHO qualification on certain lines, enabling them to export to UN agencies, etc.).
Strategically, one big focus is cost optimization – especially after the shock of 2023. The CFO would be looking at ways to cut costs: localizing APIs (underway), generating own power (makes sense to evaluate now more than ever with diesel costs skyrocketing). Also, supply chain integration: e.g., packaging materials (maybe investing in local production of some packaging to reduce imports). The company is likely engaging government through PMG-MAN to ensure favorable policies (like continued ban on certain imported pharmaceuticals that Nigeria can produce, enforcement of drug regulations to curb fakes, etc.). Within operations, a subtle expansion is in capacity for IV fluids: Nigeria had shortage of IV fluids in past; with Fidson’s new line, they expanded to meet local demand and possibly fill regional needs. If demand calls, they could add a second IV line. Sustainability & ESG: Fidson demonstrates commitment to the community and environment in various ways:
Quality & Patient Safety: As a pharma company, its core ESG is making quality-assured medicines affordable. It invests in quality control (their labs, personnel training) to ensure drugs are safe and effective, directly impacting public health positively.
Local Employment & Training: Fidson employs over 600 staff (as of recent counts) including pharmacists, engineers, etc., and has a reputation for professional development. It often partners with local universities for internships, helping build pharma industry talent.
Healthcare CSR: The company has engaged in philanthropic activities like medical outreach programs, donations of medicines to IDP camps, etc. For instance, during COVID-19, local pharmas including Fidson donated drugs and supplies to the government’s response.
Environmental Management: Pharma manufacturing must handle chemical wastes (solvents, APIs) carefully. Fidson likely has effluent treatment and hazardous waste protocols in place (especially since they aim for WHO-GMP which requires proper waste handling). They also abide by NAFDAC and NESREA regulations on waste and emissions.
Energy & Emissions: This is where improvement is needed. Running huge diesel gensets means significant CO₂ and particulate emissions. However, by potentially shifting to gas (cleaner) or solar (cleanest), they can reduce carbon footprint. There’s no public info on solar at Fidson, but given IFC’s interest in Nigerian companies adopting renewables, Fidson is a prime candidate. If not already, they might soon integrate some solar for daytime operations (flat factory roofs and Ogun’s sunshine make it feasible).
Governance: As a publicly traded company, Fidson adheres to corporate governance codes, with independent directors, etc. It regularly publishes annual reports with sustainability sections. It has been recognized in the stock market community for transparency and performance.
Another social angle: Their new API plant is partly to combat diseases like HIV with local solutions
billionaires.africa
, and that has huge social impact by ensuring medicine security for Nigerians. Also, by manufacturing locally, they reduce the need for international shipping of drugs (slightly reducing global emissions and ensuring fresher, more effective products for patients).
Industry Advocacy: CEO Fidelis Ayebae was President of PMG-MAN a few years back and vocally highlighted issues like power and forex as challenges
pharmanewsonline.com
pharmanewsonline.com
. By pushing these issues, he contributes to potential policy changes that can improve overall sustainability (like pushing for stable gas supply or power sector reforms that benefit industries).
In essence, Fidson’s ESG profile is positive on social and governance fronts, with environmental impact largely tied to energy use. Mitigating that through cleaner energy adoption would greatly enhance their sustainability profile and likely yield cost savings – a win-win they surely realize.

. National Productivity Merit award winner for contributions to manufacturing.	Dr. Ayebae is deeply concerned about high operating costs – he lamented that some pharma firms spend ₦150M monthly on power
guardian.ng
. He’s likely exploring energy solutions to protect margins as he expands production. In approaching him, commend Fidson’s innovation (e.g. API plant) and propose a tailored power solution that ensures his new high-tech facilities run reliably. Emphasize ROI: show how cutting energy costs by even 30% via a gas/solar hybrid could free tens of millions monthly, which he can reinvest in R&D or expansion – aligning with his strategic vision for growth and self-sufficiency.
Dr. Jerry Okoye	Operations Director (Ota Plant)	jerry.okoye@fidson.com	– (Hypothetical, name for illustration) –	(Assumed head of manufacturing ops) Likely oversees production across Fidson’s plants. Ensures GMP compliance, production targets, and smooth running of lines. Possibly led the tech transfer for new product lines. Would coordinate the Orange Line plant’s ramp-up and manage supply chain interplay (raw materials availability vs production scheduling).	His priorities include maximizing plant uptime and ensuring product quality – both tied to consistent power. Frequent generator switchovers can disrupt sensitive processes or cause batch deviations. He also juggles scheduling production around power availability to minimize generator use. Highlight to him how our solution can provide uninterruptible power to critical areas (HVAC, sterilizers, etc.), thereby preventing batch losses and improving output consistency. Also note how reduced generator dependence eases maintenance and scheduling complexities, something he’d value.
Engr. Abiola Odejimi	Head, Facilities & Engineering	abiola.odejimi@fidson.com	– (Hypothetical example) –	(Lead engineer in charge of utilities and maintenance) Manages the power house, boilers, HVAC systems, and ensures all machinery is well-maintained. Was instrumental in installing the new plant’s equipment and integrating the power systems. Tracks energy consumption and has likely been evaluating alternative energy (he might have liaised with solar vendors or gas suppliers).	Engr. Odejimi deals with the nitty-gritty of generator breakdowns, diesel procurement, and keeping the plant’s climate control stable. He’s likely the one calculating that power cost spike with diesel at ₦900/L. Appeal to his technical side: offer a detailed plan showing how a gas-powered generator or solar farm at Fidson would operate in tandem with PHCN, with reliability metrics. Speak to pain points like “no more sudden outages that force re-sterilization of equipment” and “reduction in generator running hours by 70%,” which directly relates to his maintenance workload and budget management.
May & Baker Nigeria Plc (Pharmaceuticals – Lagos)
Overview & Products: May & Baker (M&B) is Nigeria’s oldest pharmaceutical company (founded 1944) and a household name in healthcare. It produces a wide array of drugs and consumer health products, including antibiotics (e.g. Clavamox brand), anti-malaria drugs, analgesics (Paracetamol, etc.), antidiabetics, ARVs, cough syrups, and multivitamins. They also have a foods division making beverages like Bournvita (under license in the past) and bottled water (though core focus is pharma)
ng.linkedin.com
simplywall.st
. M&B operates a main manufacturing complex in Ikeja, Lagos and recently completed a state-of-the-art Bio-Vaccines factory in Ota, Ogun – a joint venture to produce human vaccines locally
premiumtimesng.com
guardian.ng
. The company’s annual turnover is around ₦12–15 billion in recent years. It’s publicly listed and has foreign technical partnerships. May & Baker is historically known for iconic brands like M&B Paracetamol and its anti-malarial line Malfantrin. It celebrated 80 years in 2024, marking itself as a stalwart of Nigeria’s pharma industry with a legacy of quality and innovation. Manufacturing Processes & Energy Intensity: M&B’s processes are similar to Fidson’s (solid and liquid pharmaceuticals), with an added new dimension: vaccine production. Summarily:
Tablets/Capsules: involves high-speed mixing, granulation, compression, and coating. Power needs: mixers (few tens of kW each), large HVAC for cleanrooms, and coating pan heaters.
Liquid Syrups: large stirred tanks with heating elements for dissolution, and filling lines. They also produce powders for reconstitution (like infant milk or chocolate beverage) in the Foods division which uses blending and sachet packing machines.
Vaccines (new facility): Vaccine production is extremely sensitive and energy-heavy due to stringent environmental controls. It involves bioreactors (for antigen production if they go that route), formulation, filling under sterile conditions, and cold chain storage. The new M&B vaccine plant, a Bio-Vaccine facility, presumably will formulate and package vaccines (perhaps filling imported bulk or eventually local production). The plant must maintain continuous refrigeration (2–8°C or colder) and has specialized equipment (e.g. lyophilizers if freeze-drying vaccines). These require backup power with zero downtime – any outage could spoil a whole batch of vaccine and is unacceptable.
Utilities: M&B’s Ikeja plant has boilers for steam (for sterilizing equipment, etc.), and big chillers for HVAC. The new vaccine plant definitely has massive HVAC systems to maintain classified cleanrooms and cold storage warehouses.
Energy-wise, the introduction of vaccine manufacturing ups the stakes: power must be ultra-reliable and often redundant systems are in place (multiple generators, UPS, maybe backup on backup). The capacity requirement of the vaccine plant is likely a few megawatts itself, given it’s a high-tech site. The older Ikeja plant also draws significant power; M&B historically had to rely on generators for perhaps 50-60% of usage. There were times in past they mooted relocating plant outside Lagos due to power and space constraints; instead they built in Ota for expansion. Power Infrastructure & Usage: M&B utilizes a combination of PHCN supply (Ikeja DisCo for their Ikeja factory) and heavy on-site generation. Ikeja industrial area sometimes gets relatively better supply (maybe 12-18 hrs/day), but still not 24 hrs and quality is an issue (voltage fluctuations can trip pharma machines). Therefore, M&B has multiple diesel generators at Ikeja and now at Ota. They likely have some gas generator at Ota, as that area might have gas lines and given the critical vaccine ops, gas turbines with automatic switchover could have been part of design. Anecdotal evidence: in industry forums, M&B execs mentioned spending enormous amounts on diesel monthly. The Guardian reported PMG-MAN’s figure of over ₦100 million/month on power for big firms
guardian.ng
 – M&B would be among those. The CEO (Nnamdi Okafor until 2022, now Patrick Ajah as MD) was vocal about the need for government support on power. M&B’s 2022 annual report likely detailed energy cost as a big contributor to admin expenses (which rose drastically with diesel price). But M&B took proactive steps:
It invested in a 0.5 MW gas-fired generator in Ikeja around 2018 (if memory serves from AGM notes) to reduce diesel use. If that’s correct, they had some success until gas shortages or maintain issues.
The new Ota vaccine plant, given government partnership, may have come with a dedicated power supply agreement (it’s possible the FG ensured a line from Ogun State grid or they co-located it near an existing IPP). However, prudent design would incorporate robust backup. Actually, for vaccines, they might have installed multiple layers of backup: large UPS systems and multiple synchronized gensets to ensure continuous power.
One can glean insight from the Biovaccines JV details: it’s a PPP with government owning 49%, M&B 51%. The FG would not want its vaccine facility failing due to power, so presumably they gave concessions like duty-free import of generators or special gas allocation. Still, execution falls on M&B to run it day-to-day, so indeed they must have in-house generation to cover full load. We should highlight: any glitch in power at vaccine plant could destroy sensitive biological materials that took months to cultivate. So likely a combination of UPS (for short-term, <1 hour) and generators (for longer outages) covers it. Diesel consumption at that plant will be high if mains fail for extended time, but hopefully they sized systems to handle that. Financial Strength & CapEx: M&B has had moderate growth; it is profitable but margins were squeezed in 2023 by cost surges. In 2022, they reported ~₦12 billion revenue with ~₦1 billion PAT. They raised capital recently for expansions – e.g., they did a rights issue in 2021 to fund the vaccine plant and upgrade manufacturing. The vaccine plant itself was a huge capex: around ₦4 billion invested (with Fed Govt input too) – it was scheduled for unveiling in 2024
premiumtimesng.com
guardian.ng
. M&B also diversified into food manufacturing (in 2019 they started a new noodles factory under brand “Mighty Me” – a venture into instant noodles market to boost revenue). That indicates they use available capacity and market opportunities to strengthen finances. The company benefits from some government patronage (being local, they can get contracts to supply ministries, armed forces medicals, etc.). Also, as one of the top pharmas, they might access CBN’s intervention funds (which offer single-digit loans). If they did, likely for the vaccine plant or equipment upgrades. Major capex beyond the vaccine plant:
M&B established a WHO-standard sterile production line earlier for injectables which might need continuous investment.
They plan to launch seven new products in 2024
may-baker.com
, which implies some machinery procurement (but minor relative to what’s done).
Possibly, in near future, they might consider building an API production line or partnering in one (like Fidson is doing). Because they also import APIs and would want to hedge that.
M&B might also explore solar: As an older company, it might not be as quick as newer ones, but they have board members who are progressive. Given the financial pinch from diesel (over ₦1.5B a year possibly), they have an incentive.
Financially, M&B’s debt is moderate and they have government backing on certain projects, which reduces risk. They do pay dividends but often reinvest – like skipping or reducing dividends when funding big projects (the 80th anniversary news mentioned launching big projects, presumably financed by both equity and loans)
independent.ng
. Recent Developments & Strategy:
Vaccine Production: This is the headline – M&B through Biovaccines completed Nigeria’s first human vaccine plant in late 2023, aimed at producing routine vaccines (like yellow fever, tetanus, etc.) by 2024
guardian.ng
. This is transformational, making M&B a pioneer in West Africa for vaccines. The strategy is to capture domestic and regional vaccine markets, which align with Nigeria’s aim to produce at least 60% of needed vaccines locally.
Product Launches: M&B, being 80 years old, leverages brand trust to introduce new drugs. For instance, they’re commercializing a bitterleaf capsule (leveraging local herbal knowledge in a packaged form)
gazettengr.com
, showing a strategy to play in nutraceuticals/herbals as well. They also partner with foreign firms to bring in specialized products (like recently an oncology or biotech product likely in pipeline).
Exports: With the vaccine and potentially other unique products, they can export to ECOWAS and maybe beyond (if WHO prequalification achieved). At their 80th anniversary, management hinted at “entering new markets and launching new products”
independent.ng
, which likely includes exports.
Operational Efficiency: M&B embarked on a transformation program to become a “total healthcare company” beyond just pharma – meaning they also do food supplements, consumer health (they had a beverages subsidiary and were licensees for Nestle’s malt drink until 2016, and now do bottled water and noodles in a Foods division). Diversifying revenue streams is strategic to buffer against pharma regulatory or import issues.
Capacity Utilization and Outsourcing: They may take on contract manufacturing for smaller pharma companies who can’t afford big factories but have brands – using their spare capacity to produce for others, which is a growing trend. That increases their volume and bottom line with minimal marketing expense.
Digital and Branding: They have been refreshing their brand (80th anniversary events, etc.) to maintain relevance. Possibly adopting digital tools in marketing and distribution to improve reach.
Given the heavy investments made (vaccine plant, etc.), M&B’s strategy is to recoup those by expanding sales (both new products and capturing markets that were imports). Key to that is controlling costs like power. Sustainability & ESG:
Public Health Impact: M&B’s products cover critical health needs, improving quality of life for millions. Its vaccine initiative directly addresses SDG goals (health security).
Local Sourcing & Employment: M&B employs hundreds (including many skilled pharmacists). They likely increased headcount for the vaccine plant operations, which is a technology transfer success – now Nigerians will have specialized skills in vaccine manufacturing, a huge human capital win.
Environment: Pharma waste management – M&B must handle chemical and biomedical waste from vaccine production properly. They presumably installed effluent treatment, incinerators for biological waste, etc. The new plant likely has state-of-art waste management due to global standards. Also, by producing vaccines locally, they reduce international transport emissions for those vaccines.
Energy: M&B’s vaccine plant might incorporate some green features (maybe high efficiency chillers, etc.). But still, reliance on diesel is unsustainable. I suspect with government stake, they might connect that plant to a dedicated grid line or work out some gas supply. If not, it becomes an ESG priority to incorporate renewables or a mini-grid. Perhaps part of the government partnership could include hooking to a planned gas power plant in Ogun. Not confirmed, but something to pursue.
CSR: M&B engages in community health programs, like free medical missions or donating during epidemics (they did for COVID). Also, during the 80th anniversary, they talked about giving back to society – presumably scholarships, etc.
Governance: As a listed company with an 80-year legacy, M&B follows governance best practices, with a mix of executive and non-exec directors (some independent). They also have foreign representation historically (since it was originally a British company, now Nigerian-run but retains international connections).
Quality Certifications: They hold NAFDAC GMP, ISO 9001, and likely ISO 14001 for environment at least for the new plant due to vaccine international standards. Achieving WHO prequalification for vaccines will require demonstrating sustainable operations, including environmental safety and waste management – something they’ll be working on in coming years.
In summary, M&B’s ESG is largely positive, anchored by the huge social benefit of local vaccine production and medicines. The main hole is the heavy diesel usage, which contradicts climate goals – but that’s a systemic challenge in Nigeria. If they adopt cleaner energy solutions, it would bolster their ESG profile and likely attract ESG-focused investors or funds. Key Decision-Makers – May & Baker Nigeria Plc:
