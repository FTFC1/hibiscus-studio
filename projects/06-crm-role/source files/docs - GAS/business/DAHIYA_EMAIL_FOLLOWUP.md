**Subject:** Mikano International - Power Solutions for Sunflag Group

Dear Mr. Dahiya,

I hope this email finds you well. 

I tried calling you earlier today but your line was busy. My name is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International.

I've been researching Sunflag Group and was impressed to learn about your exclusive contract as the military uniform supplier to the Nigerian Army. Given the critical nature of maintaining consistent production for such an important contract, I imagine power reliability is a key operational priority.

We've been working with textile manufacturers and have seen significant power cost reductions (typically 40%) while improving reliability. I'd welcome the opportunity to show you exactly how this could work for Sunflag Group's operations.

Would you be available for a brief call this week to discuss your current power setup? Our technical team can then draft a custom solution proposal specific to your requirements.

You can reach me directly at [your phone] or reply to this email.

Best regards,

Feyintola Folarin-Coker
