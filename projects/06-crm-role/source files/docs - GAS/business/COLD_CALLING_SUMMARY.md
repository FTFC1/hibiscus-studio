# Cold Calling Campaign Summary - Nigerian Manufacturing

## **THE CHALLENGE**
Feyintola Folarin-Coker (Mikano International) targeting Nigerian manufacturing executives for power solutions. Strong family credibility + company reputation, but struggling with contact quality.

## **WHAT WORKED**
- **Cultural approach refined:** Relationship-first, specific research, avoid generic "power reliability" 
- **Sunflag Group called back!** Proves approach gets attention
- **Script framework:** "Good morning Mr [Name], this is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International. I noticed [specific finding]. [Smart question]?"

## **CONTACT SOURCING REALITY**
**Problem:** Public directories = customer service lines, not decision makers

**Tried:**
- Company websites: Mix of working/dead numbers
- NGContacts.com: ₦50K but unverified quality  
- 6000Profiles: ₦120K but outdated
- LinkedIn: Doesn't work in Nigerian business culture

**Current Option:** D7 Leads ($21/month, 5K leads daily) - Google Maps scraping

## **CORE ISSUE REMAINS**
Even stable Nigerian numbers (NIN/BVN linked) don't solve the fundamental problem: **Getting executive direct lines vs customer service numbers.**

## **NEXT STEPS**
1. Test D7 Leads ($21 gamble)
2. Cross-verify via company websites
3. WhatsApp validation before calling
4. Focus on referral approach (leverage any connections)

## **KEY INSIGHT**
Nigerian B2B ≠ Western LinkedIn culture. Direct calls + WhatsApp + referrals = Real approach.

**Status:** Need quality contact source, not more cold calling technique.
