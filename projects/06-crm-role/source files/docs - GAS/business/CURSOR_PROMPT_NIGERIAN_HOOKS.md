# Comprehensive Cursor AI Prompt: Nigerian Manufacturing Cold Calling Hooks

## Context & Instructions

You are creating culturally appropriate cold calling hooks and follow-up insights for Nigerian manufacturing companies based on existing Claude research documentation. Your goal is to generate relationship-focused, fact-based conversation starters that respect Nigerian business culture while avoiding unverifiable claims.

## Cultural Framework for Nigerian Business Communication

**Key Principles:**
- Nigerian business is relationship-first, not transaction-first
- Respect for hierarchy and titles is mandatory
- Use formal, respectful language ("Chief," "Doctor," "Engineer")  
- Focus on long-term partnership rather than immediate sales
- Personal connection precedes professional discussion
- Patience and multiple touchpoints are expected and valued
- Allow for proper greetings and relationship building

## Your Task

Using the provided Claude research document [@/Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/Documents/PARA/Areas/Career/MI/Gas/Documents/added/claude deep research.txt] on Nigerian manufacturing companies (Sunflag, Viju Industries, Deli Foods, etc.), generate improved cold calling hooks that follow this structure:

### For Each Company, Create:

1. **Opening Hook (10-15 seconds maximum)**
   - Relationship-focused introduction
   - Reference to verified research finding
   - Culturally appropriate Nigerian business tone
   - No unverifiable numerical claims
   - Respectful greeting and family well-wishes

2. **Kiki Insight (Follow-up statement)**
   - Deeper context based on research
   - Relevant industry pain point connection
   - Conversation bridge to business discussion
   - Partnership language, not vendor language

## Strict Verification Requirements

**BEFORE including ANY numerical data, you must:**
- ✅ Verify the claim exists in the source research
- ✅ Check if the number has a credible source citation
- ✅ Ensure the timeframe/context is clearly specified
- ❌ NEVER include unverified employee counts
- ❌ NEVER estimate savings amounts without data
- ❌ NEVER claim specific spoilage percentages without proof
- ❌ NEVER invent production numbers or growth rates

**If you cannot verify a number, replace with qualitative insights from the research.**

## Nigerian Manufacturing Pain Points (Use as Conversation Starters)

Based on current industry research, focus on these verified challenges:
- Power costs (companies spent ₦144.5bn on alternative energy in 2022)
- Foreign exchange access restrictions
- Infrastructure deficits increasing production costs
- High borrowing costs and finance challenges
- Export logistics and port inefficiencies
- Skills shortage in technical and management roles
- Supply chain disruptions
- Regulatory compliance costs

## Hook Template Framework

### Opening Structure (3-5 seconds max):
"Good morning Mr [First Name - phonetic], this is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International. I noticed [specific recent finding]. Is [challenge] affecting operations?"

### Follow-up Insight Structure (if they engage):
"We've seen [specific benefit] with [industry] operations. If you could share your current setup, I have our team draft something to show exactly how this works for your company."

## Research Depth Requirements

**Avoid Obviously Googleable Facts:**
- ❌ "Largest manufacturer in region"  
- ❌ "Founded in [year]"
- ❌ "Located in [city]"
- ❌ Vague "recent expansion"

**Find Specific, Dated Business Intelligence:**
- ✅ Exact month/quarter of facility openings
- ✅ Specific equipment purchases with dates
- ✅ Named partnership announcements with timelines
- ✅ Production milestone achievements
- ✅ Regulatory approvals or certifications obtained
- ✅ Export contract wins or market entries

## Pronunciation & Respect Strategy

**Include Phonetic Guide for Each Contact:**
```
**Contact:** Sandeep Dahiya
**Pronunciation:** Mr Dah-HEE-ya  
**Script:** "Good morning Mr Dahiya, this is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International..."
```

**Include Phonetic Guide for Nigerian Locations:**
```
**Igbessa, Ogun State:** "Ig-BESS-ah, OH-gun State"
**Kaduna:** "Kah-DOO-nah" 
**Iganmu:** "Ee-GAHN-moo"
```

## Honest Experience Language

**Instead of:** "We've seen significant power cost reductions with textile operations running continuous shifts..."

**Use:** "We've seen 40% power cost reductions with textile operations. If you could share your current setup, I can show exactly how this works for Sunflag."

**Keep It Short:**
- ✅ Specific benefit percentage
- ✅ Direct request for their info
- ✅ Immediate value promise
- ✅ Company-specific focus

## Example Format (Updated for Professional Impact):

**Company: Sunflag Group**
**Decision Maker: Mr Sandeep Dahiya (Dah-HEE-ya)**

**Opening Hook (3-5 seconds):** 
"Good morning Mr Dahiya, this is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International. I noticed Sunflag is the exclusive military uniform supplier to the Nigerian Army. Is power consistency critical for maintaining that contract?"

**Kiki Insight (if they engage):** 
"We've seen 40% power cost reductions with textile operations. If you could share your current setup, I have our team draft something to show exactly how this works for your company."

**Specific Research Used:**
- ✅ Exclusive Nigerian Army uniform contract (2024 verified)
- ✅ Power consistency linked to contract maintenance
- ✅ Shows understanding of business-critical operations

**Company: Viju Industries**
**Decision Maker: Managing Director**

**Opening Hook (3-5 seconds):** 
"Good morning Mr [Name], this is Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International. I noticed your recent 80-hectare cattle rearing project in Ig-BESS-ah. Is power reliability crucial for your million-unit daily production?"

**Kiki Insight (if they engage):** 
"We've seen significant power cost reductions with food manufacturing operations. If you could share your current setup, I have our team draft something to show exactly how this works for your company."

**Specific Research Used:**
- ✅ 80-hectare cattle project in Igbessa, Ogun State (2025 verified)
- ✅ Million-unit daily production capacity
- ✅ Power reliability critical for food manufacturing

## Why This Follow-Up Works Better

**"I have our team draft something":**
- ✅ Implies you have technical backing
- ✅ Shows professional process
- ✅ More consultative approach
- ✅ Natural, conversational language

**"For your company" instead of "for [Company Name]":**
- ✅ More personal and direct
- ✅ Flows better in conversation
- ✅ Less scripted sounding

## Name Options for Easy Pronunciation

**Full Professional:** "Feyintola Folarin-Coker from Mikano International"
**Shortened Option:** "Fae and Tola from Mikano International" 
**Use the option that feels most natural for each call**

## Credibility Leverage Strategy

**Your Key Advantages to Emphasize:**
1. **Surname Recognition** - FT carries political family weight
2. **Mikano International** - Established brand authority in Nigerian market
3. **Professional Competence** - Well-spoken, prepared, knowledgeable

**Opening Formula:**
- **Company Authority:** "FT from Mikano International" (immediate credibility)
- **Research Proof:** "I've been researching [Company]" (shows preparation)
- **Specific Fact:** "[Verified finding]" (demonstrates real knowledge)
- **Direct Question:** "Is [challenge] affecting your operations?" (gets straight to business relevance)

## Simplified Title Structure

**Use Simple, Respectful Addressing:**
- "Mr [First Name]" for all male contacts
- "Mrs [First Name]" for all female contacts  
- Skip complex titles unless specifically known
- Let your surname and company do the credibility work

**Remove These Elements:**
- Family well-wishes (unnecessary time waste)
- "Many manufacturers mention..." (weakens your specific research)
- Complex Nigerian title guessing
- Relationship-building small talk in opening

## Quality Standards (Updated)

Each hook must be:
- ✅ **3-5 seconds maximum delivery**
- ✅ **Leads with credibility** (FT + Mikano)
- ✅ **Demonstrates specific research**
- ✅ **Direct business relevance question**
- ✅ **Based on verified facts only**
- ✅ **Professional but concise tone**

3. **10-15 second opening hook** (relationship-focused)
4. **Kiki insight follow-up** (conversation bridge)
5. **List of verified facts used** (with research confirmation)
6. **Cultural appropriateness verification checklist**

## Success Criteria

The hooks should achieve:
- Respectful, professional tone appropriate for Nigerian business culture

4. **Create direct conversation starters** that get to business relevance quickly
5. **Leverage FT surname and Mikano credibility** immediately
