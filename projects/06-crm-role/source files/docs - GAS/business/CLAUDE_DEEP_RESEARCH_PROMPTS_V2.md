## **PROMPT 2: NIGERIAN BUSINESS CULTURE & EMAIL STRATEGY DEEP ANALYSIS**

You are a Nigerian business culture expert, B2B communication specialist, and sales psychology analyst with deep understanding of West African corporate dynamics. Provide comprehensive cultural intelligence framework for gas power solution sales to Nigerian manufacturing executives.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

**Nigerian Business Hierarchy and Decision-Making (400+ words):** Traditional corporate structures, respect protocols, seniority acknowledgment, decision-making flow from CEO to operations, influence mapping for power infrastructure decisions, regional variations (Lagos vs Northern traditions), family business dynamics, board composition, procurement committees, technical vs relationship factors, and timeline expectations for infrastructure investments.

**Communication Protocols and Relationship-Building (400+ words):** Formal greeting requirements, proper titles and honorifics, opening relationship-building periods, courtesy protocols (family/health inquiries), respect demonstrations through company achievement acknowledgment, trust-building phases (Introduction → Relationship → Business → Partnership), professional reference importance, educational background respect, industry association involvement, religious/cultural sensitivity, and relationship maintenance expectations.

**Email Communication Framework (400+ words):** Subject line psychology (achievement acknowledgment vs direct business), opening paragraph formulas balancing respect with purpose, cultural greetings with regional variations, company compliment strategies, value proposition presentation (technical vs financial benefits), problem acknowledgment without implying incompetence, solution positioning as collaborative partnership, closing approaches, signature requirements, and follow-up etiquette with timing and escalation.

**Optimal Timing and Communication Channels (300+ words):** Email optimization (Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM WAT analysis), weekly rhythms, monthly cycles, quarterly planning integration, holiday calendar impact (Christian/Muslim/traditional festivals), Ramadan adjustments, regional timing variations, meeting preferences (in-person vs video vs phone), response timeframes, and communication channel hierarchies.

**Decision-Maker Psychology Deep Dive (400+ words):** CEO/MD psychology (strategic vision, legacy concerns, risk management, financial stewardship, industry reputation, succession planning), Operations Director psychology (efficiency optimization, performance metrics, team leadership, process improvement, technical credibility, budget accountability), Plant Manager psychology (technical expertise, day-to-day operations, safety responsibility, maintenance planning, vendor relationships, innovation interest).

**Value Proposition Messaging Framework (400+ words):** Power reliability messaging for Nigerian context, cost savings calculations (diesel vs gas), productivity improvements, environmental responsibility, technical superiority emphasis, local support infrastructure, financing options, competitive advantage positioning, risk mitigation, and scalability potential.

**Regional and Industry-Specific Considerations (300+ words):** Lagos business culture (fast-paced, international, relationship-focused), Abuja dynamics (government influence, formal protocols), Northern states (traditional practices, religious sensitivity), Port Harcourt (oil industry influence), and sector-specific approaches for food/beverage, chemical, textile, and pharmaceutical industries.
