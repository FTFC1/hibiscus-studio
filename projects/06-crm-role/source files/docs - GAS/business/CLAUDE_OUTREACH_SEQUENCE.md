## COLD CALLING SCRIPT (UPDATED - Nigerian Business Format)

### **Opening Script (10 seconds)**
```
"Hi Mr/Mrs [First Name], my name is [Your Name] from Mikano International. 
I'm calling regarding the supply of gas generators to your esteemed organisation. 

Do you have time to speak now or can we set up a time to talk about this opportunity?"
```

### **If They Say "Tell Me More" (30 seconds)**
```
"Thank you. We supply MTU gas generators that help manufacturers 
reduce diesel costs by 60% while ensuring reliable power. 

Companies similar to yours typically save ₦200-500 million annually 
with our solutions.

I'd like to schedule 30 minutes to show you exactly how this works 
for [Company Name]. Would this week or next week be better for you?"
```

### **If They Say "Send Information"**
```
"Of course. To send you the most relevant information, may I ask - 
what's your current power capacity and biggest power challenge?

[Listen]

Perfect. I'll prepare something specific for your situation. 
But these solutions work best when we can discuss your specific needs. 
Could we schedule 20 minutes next week to review it together?"
```

### **If They Say "Not Interested"**
```
"I understand. May I ask what your current power solution is?

[If diesel]: That's exactly why I called - we help companies move from 
expensive diesel to more cost-effective gas.

like to explore cost reduction opportunities, please keep us in mind."

---

### **TRANSITION TO MEETING (CRITICAL)**

*Our engineering team can do a free power audit and show you exact savings calculations. Would Tuesday or Wednesday work better for a 30-minute meeting?"*

## 🔹 CRITICAL VERIFICATION (4 Questions That Make/Break Calls)

**Ask Your Sales Partner Before First Call:**

### **1. Maintenance Claims (CRITICAL)**
**"What exactly can I promise about maintenance - is it MTU direct support or Mikano support? Where are the actual service locations?"**
*Risk: Promising service we don't provide kills credibility*

### **2. Gas Supply Guarantees (CRITICAL)** 
**"Can I promise gas availability, or just say 'we can discuss options'? Do we have actual partnerships or just referrals?"**
*Risk: Can't deliver promised gas supply = no deal*

### **3. Technical Numbers I Can Quote (CRITICAL)**
**"What uptime %, efficiency %, cost savings % am I allowed to claim? What's verified vs marketing?"**
*Risk: False claims damage reputation + lose technical credibility*

### **4. Our Delivery Advantage (CRITICAL)**
**"What's our real installation timeline vs competitors? Can I claim 'immediate stock' advantage?"**
*Risk: Promise fast delivery but can't deliver = angry customers*

---

**Everything else can be handled with:** *"Let me have our technical team provide exact specifications when we meet."*

**These 4 questions protect you from making promises that kill deals.** 🤖
