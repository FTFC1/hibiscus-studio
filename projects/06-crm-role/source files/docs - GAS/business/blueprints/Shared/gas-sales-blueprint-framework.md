**Date:** January 2025  
**Tags:** gas-sales, industrial-clients, power-champions, account-based-sales, nigeria


## 🎯 **Core Framework**

**The Three Pillars for Gas Sales Success**
- High TAM (Total Addressable Market) - Nigerian industrial companies
- Message-Market Fit - Power cost reduction messaging per industry
- Unique Positioning - Infrastructure partner vs gas supplier

**Volume Reality Check**
- Target: 300 qualified conversations/month
- 50 technical assessments/month  
- 10 signed contracts/month
- Average deal size: £2-5M annually


## 📊 **The Mathematics**

**Decent Performance Metrics (5/40/20 rule)**
- 5% response rate from power champions → 15 responses from 300 contacts
- 40% request technical assessment → 6 assessments  
- 20% conversion rate → 1.2 deals/month

**Conservative Performance (3/25/15 rule)**
- 3% response rate from 500 contacts → 15 responses
- 25% request assessment → 3.75 assessments
- 15% conversion → 0.56 deals/month

**ROI Validation (£3M average deal)**
- 50% of assessments proceed to proposal stage
- 20% close rate = 2 deals/month minimum
- Revenue: £6M/month from operational investment


## 🎯 **TAM Strategy - Nigerian Industrial Market**

**Minimum Requirements**
- 15,000+ manufacturing companies (high power consumption)
- 8,000+ healthcare facilities (critical power needs)
- 12,000+ educational institutions (budget constraints)
- 25,000+ commercial properties (operational efficiency focus)

**High-Value Industries (£500k+ annual power costs)**
- Cement manufacturing (Dangote, BUA, Lafarge)
- Steel production (Ajaokuta, Delta Steel)
- Textile manufacturing (Kaduna, Kano industrial zones)
- Food processing (Nestle, Unilever, PZ Cussons)
- Pharmaceutical manufacturing (GSK, Pfizer local operations)
- Banking headquarters (GTBank, Access, Zenith)
- Telecommunications infrastructure (MTN, Airtel, Glo)

**TAM Expansion Methods**

**Vertical Expansion (Going Up-Market)**
- Factory managers → Plant directors → Regional operations → Corporate headquarters
- Facility managers → Engineering directors → Chief operating officers
- Local operations → Regional hubs → Continental headquarters

**Horizontal Expansion (Adjacent Industries)**
- Manufacturing → Warehousing → Distribution centres → Logistics hubs
- Healthcare → Pharmaceuticals → Medical device manufacturing
- Education → Research institutions → Government facilities


## 💬 **Message-Market Fit by Industry**

**Industry Language Principle**
- Manufacturing: "Production efficiency," "uptime," "operational costs"
- Healthcare: "Patient safety," "critical systems," "regulatory compliance"
- Banking: "Business continuity," "operational resilience," "cost optimization"
- Telecommunications: "Network reliability," "infrastructure stability," "service availability"

**Research Framework for Power Champions**

**Industry Pain Point Mapping:**
"I'm researching power cost challenges in [industry]. What are the top 3 operational problems caused by unreliable/expensive power that keep [job title] up at night? What outcomes would justify a 20-30% reduction in power costs?"

**Testing Strategy**
- 3 pain points + 3 outcomes = 6 angles per industry
- A/B test messaging across similar companies
- Scale winning messages, kill underperforming angles


## 🎭 **Positioning Strategy**

**Language Hierarchy for Premium Pricing**

**Avoid (Commodity Language)**
- Gas supplier → Energy infrastructure partner
- Cost reduction → Operational transformation
- Equipment → Integrated solutions
- Service → Strategic partnership

**Premium Positioning Examples**
- "We provide energy infrastructure" vs "We supply gas"
- "Operational transformation partner" vs "Cost reduction service"
- "Strategic energy solutions" vs "Gas equipment"

**Positioning Impact Metrics**
- Premium clients: £2-5M annual contracts vs £200k equipment sales
- Sales cycle: 3-month strategic decisions vs 6-week procurement
- Competition: Limited infrastructure partners vs many equipment suppliers
- Client quality: Strategic budget holders vs cost-cutting procurement
