## Objection Responses (Concise)

### "We've invested in generators already"

```
That's sensible planning. Our solution works alongside existing generators, extending their life while reducing costs by 35%. At JOTNA, we integrated with their existing assets rather than replacing them.

Worth discussing how we could complement your current infrastructure?
```

### "Production can't tolerate disruption"

```
That's precisely why manufacturers choose us. Our implementation at JOTNA caused zero unplanned downtime. We schedule all connection work during planned maintenance and use phased commissioning.

Our technical team can explain our zero-disruption methodology in detail.
```
