## Objection Handling Guide

### "We recently invested in new generators."

**Response:** "That's actually good news - it shows you're serious about power reliability. Many of our clients like JOTNA supplement their existing generators with our gas-powered solutions, creating a hybrid system that extends generator life while reducing operational costs. We can design a solution that integrates with your existing assets rather than replacing them."

### "Gas supply is unreliable in our area."

**Response:** "We completely understand this concern. For our Intercontinental Hotel Lagos project, we implemented a solution using compressed natural gas (CNG) delivery when pipeline access wasn't available. We also design systems with diesel backup capabilities to ensure 100% reliability regardless of gas supply fluctuations. Our team conducts a thorough assessment to determine the most reliable fuel strategy for your specific location."

### "We're worried about the regulatory complexity."

**Response:** "That's a valid concern given Nigeria's evolving energy regulations. At Mikano, we handle all regulatory aspects of the project. For our NNPC project in Abuja, we managed the entire permitting process. Our team has established relationships with key regulatory bodies and deep understanding of compliance requirements, allowing your team to focus on your core business while we manage these complexities."

### "The contract term is too long."

**Response:** "I understand your hesitation about long-term commitments. The contract duration is directly related to the economics of the project - longer terms allow us to offer lower rates. However, we can explore flexible structures like shorter base terms with extension options, or performance-based early termination provisions. We've implemented such flexible approaches for clients with similar concerns, allowing them to benefit from the cost savings while maintaining future flexibility."

### "Your rate isn't competitive enough compared to our current costs."

**Response:** "I appreciate your focus on economics. To ensure we're comparing accurately, may I ask about your fully-loaded power costs, including fuel, maintenance, parts, labor, and amortized capital costs? Many businesses find their actual costs are 15-20% higher than their tracked fuel costs alone. Additionally, we should factor in the production impacts of any current reliability issues. For [Similar Company], the improved reliability added another 12% in effective savings beyond the direct cost reduction."
