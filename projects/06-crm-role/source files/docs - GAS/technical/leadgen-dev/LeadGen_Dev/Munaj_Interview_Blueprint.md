# MUNAJ SALES PARTNER INTERVIEW BLUEPRINT
**Date**: Interview 001 | **Source**: Sales Partnership Strategy Session


## 🎯 **Business Model Clarity**

**IPP Strategy Pivot**
- Business shifted from direct IPP provision to engine sales to IPP providers
- Three IPP partners: Junaid (brother's friend, paid for 3 engines), Kabota (2 engines reserved), Welbeck (no payment yet)
- Target: Sell engines to IPP providers who then sell power to end customers
- Rationale: IPP business "not profitable" according to Chairman

**Revenue Model**
- Engine sales: $700k USD per unit (~₦1.1bn each at ₦1,607/$)
- Commission structure: 2% on deals (₦22M per ₦1.1bn deal)
- Target: 4-6 deals annually = ₦88-132M revenue
- Customer payback: 1.5-2 years on engine purchase vs power contracts


## 📊 **Current Stock & Urgency**

**Inventory Pressure**
- 30 units of 1.1MW engines (corrected from interview)
- 12 units of 1.5MW engines (priority to move)
- 1 unit of 2MW engine
- Total: 43 units = ~₦47bn tied up in stock
- Must sell before new stock arrives (liquidity constraint)

**Competitive Positioning**
- MTU engines (German manufacturer, premium quality) vs cheaper German competitors (MWM)
- MTU Aero Engines AG: Leading German aircraft & industrial gas turbine manufacturer
- Advantage: Stock availability (8-month lead time for competitors)
- Disadvantage: Premium pricing vs similar quality alternatives


## 🎯 **Target Market Intelligence**

**Priority Industries**
1. **Manufacturing** (24/7 operations, can't rely on NEPA/diesel)
2. **Hospitality** (hotels, space constraints favour higher MW units)
3. **Telecoms** (reliable power critical)

**Customer Capacity Assessment**
- All target companies can afford engines outright
- Decision factor: Do they want to own vs buy power?
- Power costs: ₦180-200M monthly average
- Engine ROI: 1.5-2 year payback period

**Geographic Focus**
- Nigeria priority (gas availability + cost advantage)
- Regional expansion depends on gas infrastructure and pricing vs diesel


## 📧 **Outreach Strategy & Challenges**

**Email Effectiveness Debate**
- Munaj's experience: "Email doesn't work in Nigeria"
- Traditional approach: Word-of-mouth, relationship-based penetration
- Proposed volume: 230 emails/week to 3 contacts per company
- Compromise: Email for tracking opens, then phone follow-up

**Alternative Channels**
- Industry events (Mining Week November, air conditioning conventions)
- Site visits and relationship building
- Business cards: "Business Developer" or "Power Consultant" titles


## 🔄 **Sales Process & Timeline**

**End-to-End Process**
1. Lead qualification (existing power setup, expansion vs replacement)
2. Affordability assessment (direct purchase vs IPP route)
3. Site inspection and bill of quantities
4. Gas pipeline requirements (10-year contracts for 2MW+)
5. Pricing: Power-only vs power+gas (3x cost without pipeline)
6. Sales invoice to IPP partner
7. 10-year customer contract (company exits relationship)

**Timeline Management**
- Sales cycles: 12-18 months average
- Follow-up cadence: Weekly (not daily to avoid frustration)
- Meeting capacity: 15-20 companies weekly manageable
- Current pipeline: Welbeck 15MW deal (6 months to close, started March)
