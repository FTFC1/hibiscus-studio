# User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v4)

**Users:** 
- FT (System Architect & Process Owner): Manages the automated outreach system, data enrichment, and campaign execution
- Munaj (Sales Partner): Handles networking events, direct interactions, and closing qualified leads

**Primary Goal:** Systematically generate and qualify leads to book 20 qualified sales calls per week for Mikano power solutions (generators, IPPs), supplementing existing networking-based lead generation.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Multi-Channel Approach:** Combine Munaj's networking/event-based lead generation (primarily targeting government and manufacturing sectors) with FT's systematic outreach system (targeting a broader range of sectors including healthcare, hospitality, and agriculture).
*   **Robust TAM:** The Nigerian market presents a substantial Total Addressable Market. With millions of registered businesses and tens of thousands of entities in power-hungry sectors like manufacturing (thousands), healthcare (~40,000 hospitals/clinics), hospitality (~14,000+ hotels), and large-scale agriculture, achieving 20 additional qualified calls weekly via systematic outreach is feasible.
*   **Systematisation for Scale (FT's Domain):** Build defined processes, data management, and tools for the scalable part of lead generation, managed by FT.
*   **Message-Market Fit (Nigerian Context):** Test and refine messaging for specific industry segments. Messaging must resonate with Nigerian business needs, emphasizing reliability, cost-savings, and understanding of local operational challenges (e.g., impact of power unreliability).
*   **AI Leverage (Strategic):** Use AI where it adds efficiency without sacrificing the quality and trust essential in the Nigerian market.
*   **Focus on Outcomes:** All system activities should directly contribute to providing qualified leads ready for a meaningful sales conversation.
*   **Manual Insight Collection:**
    *   **Munaj's Role:** Gather insights from networking events (particularly with government and manufacturing decision-makers). These insights (pain points, successful angles, objections) inform system improvements.
    *   **FT's Role:** Regularly review automated processes to capture insights, refine targeting, and understand customer pain points from system-generated leads.

**Assumptions:**
*   Munaj's personal interactions at events build strong rapport with government and manufacturing sector decision-makers.
*   FT's systematic outreach can effectively target sectors not easily reached through networking events (healthcare, agriculture, etc.).
*   Publicly available data (news, company databases, industry reports), when enriched and filtered, can indicate a company's likelihood to need power solutions.
*   Targeted, semi-automated outreach, with messaging adapted for Nigerian cultural and business norms, is more effective than generic blasts.
*   Mikano's brand recognition in Nigeria provides credibility that can be leveraged in outreach.
*   The questionnaire process provides valuable qualification data but requires manual handling.
*   An email volume of 4,000-8,000 per month will be necessary to generate the targeted number of qualified leads.

## Parallel Lead Generation Approaches

### Channel 1: Event & Relationship-Driven Lead Generation (Munaj's Focus)

**Trigger:** Munaj attends social/industry events, leverages personal network.

1.  **Networking & Initial Conversations (Munaj)**
    *   Discuss Mikano power solutions, identify potential needs through conversation, build rapport.
    *   Particularly effective with government officials and manufacturing sector contacts who attend these events.
    *   Share general themes, common questions, and types of companies showing interest with FT to inform system targeting.

2.  **Transition to Direct Communication (Munaj)**
    *   Exchange contact details, typically leading to WhatsApp conversations or calls.
    *   Build ongoing dialogue and relationship.

3.  **Deeper Qualification & Site Visits (Munaj)**
    *   Understand specific needs, power challenges, budget considerations. May involve site visits.
    *   Send the Mikano questionnaire to gather specific technical requirements.
    *   Log key information from these interactions detailing customer pain points, decision drivers, successful arguments, and reasons for lost deals.

### Channel 2: Systematic Outreach Lead Generation (FT's Focus)

**Trigger:** Ongoing process, reviewed weekly by FT, with input from Munaj.

#### Phase 1: Market Identification & Lead Sourcing

1.  **Define & Refine Target Market Segments (FT with Munaj's Input)**
    *   Identify primary industries in Nigeria with high power needs, particularly those less reached through networking (e.g., healthcare, agriculture, hospitality, education).
    *   Explore vertical (upmarket/downmarket) and horizontal (adjacent industries) expansion opportunities.
    *   Define ideal company profiles (size, locations/states, specific triggers like "new factory," "expansion plans," "reported power issues").
    *   Store these definitions as searchable profiles/criteria.

2.  **High-Volume Lead Sourcing (FT System / Manual)**
    *   Use company databases (local directories, industry-specific databases, custom web scraping).
    *   Define search criteria based on market segments.
    *   Extract lead lists (company name, website, industry, location, relevant contact titles).
    *   Store in a central database managed by FT.
    *   FT periodically reviews lists to spot-check relevance and assess data quality.

3.  **Initial Data Cleaning (FT System)**
    *   Remove obvious duplicates and incomplete entries from the sourced list.
    *   Present a cleaner list of potential companies for enrichment.

#### Phase 2: Enrichment & Qualification

4.  **Company & Contact Enrichment (FT System)**
    *   For each company, gather:
        *   More detailed industry classification
        *   Specific news mentions related to expansion, power challenges, new projects (Nigerian sources prioritized)
        *   Identify likely key contact persons/departments (Operations, Procurement, Engineering, C-level)
    *   Populate richer company profiles
    *   FT reviews samples weekly to validate data quality and ensure automation is capturing useful information for the Nigerian context

5.  **Lead Scoring & Prioritisation (FT System with Munaj's Input)**
    *   Score leads based on:
        *   Industry match (weighted by known power needs)
        *   Recent relevant news (e.g., expansion, power complaints)
        *   Indication of company size or energy consumption
        *   Completeness of company data
    *   FT reviews top-scored companies and adds qualification notes based on quick research
    *   Munaj provides occasional input on "High Potential Companies" based on market intuition
    *   Sort companies by score and flag for follow-up

#### Phase 3: Contact Identification & Outreach

6.  **Identify Key Contact Persons (FT/Assistant)**
    *   For high-potential companies, identify specific names and email addresses for relevant roles (Operations Director, MD, Chief Engineer, Procurement Head)
    *   Create a list of target contacts with verified details for the outreach campaign

7.  **Personalization Development (FT with AI Assistance)**
    *   For target contacts, use key data (company name, industry, relevant news snippet) to generate potential opening lines for emails
    *   FT crafts, refines, and reviews all messaging to ensure relevance and appropriate tone for Nigerian business communication
    *   Focus on value propositions specific to Mikano's offerings and Nigerian businesses

8.  **Email Campaign Execution (FT)**
    *   Set up email sequences (1-3 emails) leveraging insights from successful interactions
    *   Send using FT's email account (either via Mikano email or a dedicated domain with mailr.io)
    *   Volume: Target 1,000-2,000 emails per week (to achieve ~20 qualified calls/week)
    *   Clearly articulate how Mikano power solutions address specific Nigerian business pain points
    *   Use culturally appropriate calls to action
    *   Track opens, clicks, and replies

#### Phase 4: Engagement & Qualification

9.  **Manage Positive Replies (FT with Munaj's Support)**
    *   **Reply Detection System:**
        *   Set up email filters/rules to automatically tag and highlight replies
        *   Use email platform (Instantly.ai/Mailshake) reply tracking features
        *   Designate specific checking times (morning/evening) to review campaign inbox
        *   Create a simple "positive reply" folder or tag system
    *   FT handles initial responses, qualifying the lead further
