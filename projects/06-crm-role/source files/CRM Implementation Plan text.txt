CRM Implementation Plan

FT Coker - Aug 2024
Enhancing Efficiency and Customer Relationships

Introduction
The CRM implementation project aims to address key challenges and improve overall efficiency in customer relationship management. Primary objectives are:
Enhance Sales Tracking: Improve the accuracy and efficiency of sales tracking across all divisions.
Streamline Customer Relationship Management: Develop a more united approach to managing customer interactions and relationships.
Increase Operational Efficiency: Optimise processes to reduce inefficiencies and improve overall productivity.
Phased Implementation: Provide a structured, phased approach that can be initially applied to the Motors division and subsequently expanded to other divisions.

Current State
Fragmented Processes: Current workflows are disjointed, leading to inefficiencies and errors.
Manual Tracking: Reliance on manual tracking methods results in inconsistent data and increased workload.
Departmental Silos: Lack of integration between departments hampers communication and collaboration.


Desired State
Integrated Processes: Streamlined workflows with integrated systems for seamless operations.
Interaction Tracking: Reliable and consistent data with automated tracking methods.
Unified Departments: Improved communication and collaboration through integrated departmental processes.
VS
Sales Pipeline Tracking: Automating the tracking of leads through various stages of the sales process, from initial contact to closed deals.
Customer Interaction Tracking: Automatically logging and categorizing all customer interactions, including emails, phone calls, and meetings.
Ticketing System: An automated system for creating, assigning, and tracking customer service tickets from creation to resolution.
Performance Metrics: Automated tracking of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as conversion rates, sales cycle length, and customer satisfaction scores.
Follow-up Task Management: Automated reminders and task creation for follow-up activities with customers and leads.
Data Analytics and Reporting: Automated generation of reports and dashboards for real-time insights into sales and customer service performance.
Customer Profile Management: Automated updating of customer profiles with the latest interaction data and purchase history.
Marketing Automation: In later phases, the plan mentions exploring marketing automation features, which could include automated email campaigns and lead nurturing processes.



Current Challenges
Operational Efficiency:
Current processes require manual data entry across multiple systems
Time-consuming task switching between different tools and platforms
Limited visibility into overall workflow and bottlenecks

Sales Opportunity Management:
Difficulty in tracking leads throughout the sales pipeline
Follow-up processes are managed individually, which may result in missed opportunities.
Limited ability to analyse conversion rates and sales cycle length

Customer Experience Enhancement:
Fragmented customer data across different departments
Inconsistent communication channels and response times
Limited ability to provide personalised service based on customer history

External System Integration:
Multiple standalone systems with limited interconnectivity
Manual data transfer between systems increases risk of errors
Challenges in generating comprehensive reports across departments
Collecting details via whatsapp to forward to system handlers, effectively middlemannign data
Not using data collecting tools for leads and not leveraging notifications to inform those at the next stage of process that an task is ready 
Sale progress kept within department, marketing can’t align their efforts to leads and sales outcomes 
Matching data between the lead, sales and aftersales for improved CX difficult due to different systems holding data without data validations

Solution: In collaboration with ERP consultants, create a data migration plan, including data cleaning and validation steps, to ensure accurate and seamless transfer of information.
User Adoption Hurdles:
Challenge: Employees may resist using the new CRM system due to unfamiliarity or fear of change.
Solution: Provide comprehensive training and ongoing support to help employees become comfortable with the new system and understand its benefits.
Integration with Existing Systems:
Challenge: Ensuring the new CRM integrates smoothly with existing tools and systems.
Solution: Conduct thorough testing and work with IT to address any compatibility issues, ensuring seamless integration and data flow between systems.
Integration with existing ERP system:
Challenge: The new CRM may struggle to integrate with the current Oracle ERP.  
Solution: Create custom integration points or use middleware for data exchange.

Data format inconsistencies:
Challenge: Existing data formats may not match the new CRM's requirements.  
Solution: Implement data transformation during migration for compatibility.


Visualising Success: Motors 
Initially the CRM capture will be manual. As the system improves automations can be added.
CSR team performs lead qualification, assessing the nature and urgency of the inquiry.
Based on this qualification, the CSR would then categorise the ticket as Sales or After-Sales.
This process ensures proper routing and timely handling of all customer inquiries.
Process continually improves based on CRM data insights and customer feedback, allowing for ongoing optimisation.
During the lead qualification stage, the CSR would:Verify that the inquiry is indeed for the Motors Division and not for another division of the company.
Based on this qualification, the CSR would then categorize the ticket:If it's a sales inquiry for the Motors Division, it would be forwarded to the Motors Sales Rep.

CRM Team Roles in Customer Journey

Role
Current
Future
Sales Representatives
Manual lead tracking and follow-ups
Focused on relationship-building, guided by CRM insights
After Sales/Customer Service
Limited access to customer history
Comprehensive view of customer interactions across all touchpoints
Management
Limited visibility into sales pipeline and customer interactions
Real-time access to performance metrics and customer data
CRM Team (New)
Non-existent

Increased collaboration across departments


Sales CRM Benefits
Improved Follow-Up Efficiency
Before CRM: Details about follow-up frequency were managed individually by salespeople, making it hard to overview the sales pipeline. 
After CRM: With the CRM system, follow-up frequencies are tracked centrally, providing clear visibility into the sales pipeline and enabling better management of leads.
Streamlined Sales Cycle
Before CRM: We weren’t collecting data to understand sales cycles, bottlenecks, or ways to improve communication. 
After CRM: By analysing data on sales cycles, we can identify bottlenecks and streamline our communication strategies, resulting in more efficient and effective sales processes.
Example Bottleneck: Customers contacting sales teams post-purchase instead of after sales, disrupting sales activities.

After-Sales CRM Benefits
Comprehensive Customer Interaction History
Before CRM: Customer service records are detailed but not consolidated into a single profile. For a car, this means purchase history, services, repairs, due services, and preferences for reminders are not easily accessible in one place. 
After CRM: The CRM system consolidates all customer information into a clear, comprehensive profile, allowing support teams to quickly access and manage customer data.
Assisted Service Management
Before CRM: Tracking service issues and follow-ups is done manually, which can delay responses. 
After CRM: The CRM system tracks all service requests and follow-ups, ensuring timely resolutions and improved customer satisfaction.


Key Outcomes
Increased Sales Conversion Rates:
With our new CRM system, we aim to achieve a 5-8% sales conversion rate from lead to closed deal
This conservative benchmark is lower than typical industry averages (10-15%) to account for the complexity of selling across multiple industries and the initial learning curve of using a new CRM system
Reduced Issue Resolution Time:
The CRM will help reduce issue resolution time to 3-5 business days
This target is more conservative than some industry standards (1-3 days) to account for potential challenges in routing tickets across different business units and the time needed for staff to adapt to the new CRM system
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction Scores (CSAT):
We anticipate achieving a CSAT score of 60-70%
This goal is set lower than many industry standards (75-85%) to acknowledge the challenges of implementing consistent customer service practices across diverse business sectors and the time required to fully leverage CRM insights for improved customer experiences
CSAT=(Number of satisfied customers (ratings 4 and 5)/Total number of responses


Project Team
The modular design allows for easy expansion as the company grows.
Vendor-provided training will save costs and ensure best practice CRM methodologies are used across the company.
Sales Reps focus solely on sales tasks related to their specific divisions
After-Sales reps are embedded in each division, ensuring specialised support and maintaining strong customer relationships post-sale.
Pilot will be a sample: 


They will make CRM team do follow ups and be proactive with customers: service, have you gotten your first service. You’ll be doing CRM and Customer Service 
Do an Org chart of what the CRM team would look like. Have a JD of what this person would do. Right now they’ll think it’s just “analysing information” 
Current: No team, Femi/IKJ us half half + Same with Good luck 
Before and After Current 
How do the after sales people do their thing?


VN Version:

Who collects the data from sales and after sales to see visualse/data on. People for the Visualising Success flow and their roles. 
Show the progression from now to the successful flow showing who the people are that are being added.Okay, so I'm just trying to better articulate what was said to me. First, it's likely that management is going to make the CRM team do a number of follow-ups and be proactive with customers. Not that this will be something purely done by the sales reps. We'll also be saying things like, "Have you got your service? Have you done your first service? Has anyone gotten back to you?" So, doing checkups to see that things are happening, making sure that sales and office sales teams are actually doing what they need to do. It's almost like an extension of customer service. That's why we think it's likely that it would be CRM and customer service happening.

My colleague advised that I should do an organization chart of what this CRM team would look like. I might not do a full job description, but I need to have slides indicating the tasks and responsibilities of each person. Right now, they'll see it as if the team is just analyzing information, which isn't enough. They will want to know more tasks that we're doing.

Currently, we don't really have a team. We have someone effectively doing after-sales/customer service in Ikeja. I've mentioned Femi, IKJ, and he's half doing CRM, half receiving messages from customers on WhatsApp. He's also trying to book service appointments, dealing with customer complaints in the workshop, and now involved in recouping funds from customers who had their car serviced on credit. We also have Goodluck, who's managing messages from people asking about prices and questions on social media, particularly Instagram. He's also involved in marketing activities on Instagram. So that's another half-half situation.

The point is to do a before and after of the organization - what it is today and what the desired outcome is. I also need to show how people will be putting information in the after-sales team. We have this Google Sheet now for sales to input leads and add follow-up information. It has conditional formatting to show who needs follow-up and only counts people within certain stages of the sales. If an invoice is marked as lost, it's not counted. But we don't have a system for collecting after-sales information yet. We're considering Google Sheets, Notion, or HubSpot's free version.

All of this is being done to gain data to inform how we either change NATEJSOFT (the current selected tool) or a different tool to meet the teams' actual requirements based on what we learn from this pilot phase. Only then can we engage other showrooms like Abuja, Port Harcourt, and others. Showing them Google Sheets and NATEJSOFT simultaneously would be confusing. So the pilot is focused only on the VI branch for sales and the Ikeja branch for after-sales.

I have another slide on visualizing success in the motors division. They want to know who's doing which tasks, how they're involved in that flow, and showing progression from today to the future in terms of people. Currently, it's me coming up with the plan, phases, and general direction for the CRM strategy. Then it moves to the managers of sales and after-sales ensuring these tools are used to build the data we need to inform NATEJSOFT. Then it's me and someone else analyzing the information, collecting feedback, and drawing insights. Next, we'll create a requirements document to share with NATEJSOFT and other enterprise vendors. After selecting a tool, we'll develop training materials and standard operating procedures for the divisions.

Before finalizing the SOPs, we'll have conversations with different divisions to ensure alignment and address specific customization needs. This will give us customized plans for what the software or solution needs to do for these divisions. Then we can create and distribute training, start onboarding different divisions, monitor, get feedback, share that feedback with the solution provider, and proactively help ensure they're not having problems with the solution an customers are being contacted.
