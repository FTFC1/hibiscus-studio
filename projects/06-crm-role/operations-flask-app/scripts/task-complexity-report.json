      "taskTitle": "Implement Data Extraction from VIN",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the VIN extraction task into subtasks for each brand's WMI validation, check digit calculation, plant code decoding, model year decoding, error handling, and comprehensive unit testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing brand-specific logic for multiple manufacturers, each with unique VIN structures and validation rules. It requires careful handling of pattern matching, check digit algorithms, and plant code decoding, which increases cyclomatic complexity and maintainability challenges. Additional subtasks for error handling and thorough testing are recommended to ensure robustness and correctness."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Report Generation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the report generation task into subtasks for data preparation, sheet creation per brand, formatting consistency, validation of output, and documentation of the report structure.",
      "reasoning": "While the use of pandas and ExcelWriter simplifies some aspects, ensuring consistent formatting and correct brand grouping across multiple sheets adds moderate complexity. Additional subtasks for data preparation and documentation will help manage edge cases and maintain clarity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the CLI tool implementation into subtasks for argument parsing, Excel file validation, report generation integration, error handling, user feedback, logging, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a CLI tool that processes Excel files and generates formatted reports involves integrating multiple components, handling user input, and managing errors. The need for robust validation, user feedback, and logging increases the overall complexity, warranting more granular subtasks."

      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Logging",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand error handling and logging into subtasks for logging configuration, exception handling in each module (API, DB, parsers), log format validation, and documentation of logging practices.",
      "reasoning": "Configuring structured logging and contextual error handling is moderately complex, especially when ensuring consistency across modules. Additional subtasks for validation and documentation will help maintain clarity and traceability."

      "taskTitle": "Write Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down documentation into subtasks for CLI usage, Excel requirements, VIN pattern rules, troubleshooting, accessibility compliance, and review/validation.",
      "reasoning": "While documentation is less technically complex, covering multiple domains (CLI, Excel, VIN, accessibility) and ensuring clarity and compliance increases the workload. More subtasks will help ensure completeness and quality."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the test suite task into subtasks for test environment setup, test data creation, parameterized VIN tests, report output validation, coverage analysis, test data cleanup, and documentation of test cases.",
      "reasoning": "Achieving high test coverage across multiple modules (Excel processing, VIN validation, report generation) and maintaining test data integrity adds significant complexity. Additional subtasks for setup, coverage, and documentation are necessary for a robust test suite."
