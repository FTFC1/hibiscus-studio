# Mikano Motors PFI Tool - Design Principles

## Mobile-First Design
- Design for mobile first, then enhance for desktop
- Consider thumb placement and reachability on mobile devices
- Primary actions should be easily accessible with thumb navigation

## Progressive Disclosure
- Don't show all filters and search options immediately
- Use expandable sections for secondary features
- Keep the interface clean and focused on primary tasks

## Primary Actions Priority
- Creating a new PFI is the most important action
- Dashboard stats (total, active, expired, total value) are secondary
- Focus on what users actually need vs. what looks impressive

## Mobile Interface Considerations
- The "Create New PFI" card should be prominent on mobile
- Remove or minimize dashboard stats on mobile
- Ensure buttons don't interfere with text readability
- Optimize for thumb-friendly interactions

## Header Spacing
- Maintain proper spacing in headers for mobile readability
- Ensure title, branding, and progress indicators have adequate breathing room
- Header should not feel cramped or packed on mobile devices

## Table Design
- PFI table needs to be mobile-responsive
- Consider card-based layout for mobile instead of traditional table
- Show only essential information on mobile view
