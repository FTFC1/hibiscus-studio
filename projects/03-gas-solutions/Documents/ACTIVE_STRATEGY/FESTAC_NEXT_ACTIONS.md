Subject: Festac development – integrated 2.2 MW power & construction proposal

Dear Mr Rotimi,

Thank you for hosting us at your Festac Road site. Your 25-acre agro-processing and residential programme is an ideal match for Mikano's full-spectrum offering:

• Power: twin 1.1 MW MTU gas engines (2.2 MW total) with 11/33 kV step-up transformers  
• Construction: turnkey design-build management with selective subcontracting  
• Heavy Equipment: wheel loaders & excavators for site works; forklifts for warehouse ops  
• Electrical Products (MPSD): breakers, switches, lighting & distribution panels for both factory and housing

To assemble a board-ready proposal we would appreciate a few clarifications:

**Technical**
1. Cassava-line machinery data sheets (rated kW and duty cycles)  
2. Anticipated peak/average loads for the housing estate and factory  
3. Civil & MEP build schedule (including any temporary power during construction)

**Commercial**
1. Preferred week for the Chairman presentation  
2. Key stakeholders who should attend  
3. Procurement route under consideration (EPC, EPC+Finance, lease) and indicative budget

Our preliminary study indicates two trunk gas pipelines within reach of the site, keeping tie-in cost and lead-time low. We'll provide formal confirmation once our internal team completes the verification.

Could we arrange a short call this week to review the above and lock in a date for the Chairman session?

Kind regards,
[Your Name]  
Business Development – Power & Construction  
Mikano International
