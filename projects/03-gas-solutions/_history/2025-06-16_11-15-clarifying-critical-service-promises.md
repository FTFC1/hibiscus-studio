# Clarifying critical service promises (2025-06-16 12:15:13)

_**User**_

Meeting with Munaj:

### *1. Maintenance Claims (CRITICAL)*
*"What exactly can I promise about maintenance - is it MTU direct support or Mikano support? Where are the actual service locations?"*
Risk: Promising service we don't provide kills credibility

### *2. Gas Supply Guarantees (CRITICAL)* 
*"Can I promise gas availability, or just say 'we can discuss options'? Do we have actual partnerships or just referrals?"*
Risk: Can't deliver promised gas supply = no deal

### *3. Technical Numbers I Can Quote (CRITICAL)*
*"What uptime %, efficiency %, cost savings % am I allowed to claim? What's verified vs marketing?"*
Risk: False claims damage reputation + lose technical credibility

### *4. Our Delivery Advantage (CRITICAL)*
*"What's our real installation timeline vs competitors? Can I claim 'immediate stock' advantage?"*
Risk: Promise fast delivery but can't deliver = angry customers

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 Maintenance - What You Can Safely Promise  
• Offer an “Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)” with Mikano: 7 scheduled on-site services per year.  
• Warranty stays valid only if the client signs the AMC.  
• Service is carried out wherever the engine is installed (Lagos, PH, up-country).  
• Support chain: Customer → Mikano → MTU (MTU never deals directly with end-users).  
• Don’t promise: direct MTU call-outs, unlimited call-outs, or free maintenance.  

🔹 Gas Supply – Keep It to Referrals  
• Mikano has NO binding gas-offtake agreements.  
• Acceptable wording: “We can introduce trusted suppliers (Greencoke, Greenville, AXELA) and help coordinate; the supply contract is between you and them.”  
• Do not quote price, pressure, or guaranteed availability.  

🔹 Performance Numbers – Verified vs. Marketing  
(Use ranges, flag dependencies)  
• Electrical efficiency: 41-45 % \(LHV\) for MTU 4000-series gas engines (factory data, depends on gas quality).  
• Fleet availability (with AMC + clean gas): 95-97 %.  
• OPEX saving vs. diesel: 35-50 % at NGN gas price ≤ $2.00/mmBTU and diesel ≥ ₦1,200/litre (show your calculation if pushed).  
• Make it clear these are “typical results” not guarantees—site conditions and gas quality drive the actual figure.  

🔹 Delivery Advantage – Your Real Edge  
• In-country stock today:  
  – 1.1 MW: 30 units (28 available after two reservations)  
  – 1 MW: 12 units (16 in yard, but four already tagged)  
  – 2 MW: 1 unit (one of two reserved)  
• Lead time to site energisation (if foundation & gas line ready): 8-12 weeks.  
• Competitors importing new sets: 18-24 weeks + port clearance.  
• Caveats: timeline excludes civil works, containerisation, or custom balance-of-plant; clarify these before quoting.  

🔹 Quick Script for Munaj  
“Maintenance is fully handled by Mikano under our AMC—seven on-site visits yearly, with MTU engineering backing us. Gas supply isn’t bundled; we’ll connect you to trusted vendors so you negotiate directly. Typical MTU gas sets run at 41-45 % efficiency and deliver 95 %+ uptime when serviced under AMC, yielding up to 50 % fuel cost savings versus diesel. Because we stock engines locally, we can install in 8–12 weeks once your site is ready—far faster than importing.” 🤖

updated the trancript: what question should i ask? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 Maintenance Contract  
• “What exactly is included in the AMC fee—parts, labour, emergency call-outs?”  
• “What is the response-time SLA for unscheduled breakdowns?”  
• “How many MTU-certified technicians are on ground in Lagos, PH and up-country?”  
• “Do we hold critical spares locally, or are they flown in? Typical lead-time?”  
• “What voids the warranty besides missing a scheduled service?”  

🔹 Gas Supply  
• “Which suppliers (Greencoke, Greenville, AXELA, MGML) have active pipelines/CNG routes to this client’s site today?”  
• “Can we share template gas contracts so the client sees typical terms?”  
• “Who shoulders gas-quality testing and filtration costs—supplier or client?”  
• “What fallback do we propose if pipeline gas drops below spec?”  

🔹 Performance & Guarantees  
• “Can we cite independent test sheets or reference sites proving 41-45 % efficiency and 95 % uptime?”  
• “What conditions void the performance guarantee (e.g., low methane number, poor maintenance)?”  
• “Do we have case studies showing actual ₦/kWh savings vs diesel?”  

🔹 Delivery & Stock  
• “What deposit locks one of the in-country units, and for how long?”  
• “What tasks are on the critical path to keep the 8–12 week timeline (foundation, gas line, commissioning)?”  
• “If civil works slip, can we re-assign the engine stock to another client without penalty?”  

🔹 Commercial Terms  
• “Standard payment schedule—% on PO, % on shipment, % on commissioning?”  
• “Currency exposure: do we price in USD or NGN? Any rate-cap clauses?”  
• “Can we bundle the AMC into a single finance-lease package?”  

🔹 Lead & Relationship Dynamics  
• “Should we formalise a referral incentive for Shadi and other major introducers to keep lead flow predictable?”  
• “How do we capture all inbound leads (WhatsApp, phone, email) into a CRM so nothing slips?”  

🔹 Risk & Liability  
• “What liabilities do we carry if the referred gas supplier defaults?”  
• “Do we need professional-indemnity wording in our offer letters to cover performance claims?”  

Ask these in sequence to plug every credibility gap before the next client call. 🤖

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 Maintenance & Warranty  
• Can you give me the AMC price-list per MW (1 MW, 1.1 MW, 2 MW) and what each tier covers?  
• Which line-items void the MTU warranty besides missed services (e.g., non-OEM filters, gas below spec)?

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 What “bundling the AMC into a lease or PPA” really means  
• Today the client buys the engine (or signs a power-purchase agreement) AND, separately, wires a lump-sum every year for the Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC).  
• Bundling = roll that yearly AMC cost into the same monthly/kWh payment they’re already making for the asset or the power.  
 – Lease: the financier adds the AMC to the monthly lease instalment—client pays one predictable cheque, no surprise maintenance invoice.  
 – PPA: we load the AMC cost into the per-kWh tariff—client just pays for energy; upkeep is invisible in the rate.  
• Cash-flow win: avoids a chunky ₦/USD hit once a year; easier budgeting and better working-capital control.  

🔹 How to phrase the question internally  
“Can we fold the annual maintenance charge into the monthly lease repayment or the per-kWh tariff so the customer only sees a single, all-inclusive bill?” 🤖

@Munaj 002.txt Full meeting is here. So it's not that we answered every question, but we have a lot of questions. You can see now that both or he is very very strongly off the point that it has to be in person, like this cannot be something that we scale through cold email and stuff.

So I don't know, we've got a lot here, and obviously our tree structure is still a bit fucked up. Now we need to clean up and really make sure that we are utilising this information properly so that we can move forward with pace. If we can't scale to like 10,000 emails sent and we're going to have to do it in person, now we need to approach this very very differently.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.  

🔹 First, Re-frame the Goal  
Cold-blast at 10 k addresses won’t close MTU engines; the game is “high-trust, high-ticket”. Your funnel is:  
1. Warm introduction →  
2. Rapid site visit (trust signal) →  
3. Technical & financial proposal →  
4. Board sign-off.  
Optimise THAT chain, not mass email.

🔹 Clean-Up Sprint (90 mins max)  
1. Slice the long transcript into six buckets:  
   • Maintenance & Warranty  
   • Gas Supply & Referrals  
   • Technical Performance  
   • Stock & Delivery  
   • Commercial Terms  
   • Lead Sources / Deal Flow  
2. Drop each bucket into its own Markdown file inside `Docs/Deal_Knowledge_Base/`.  
3. Inside each file keep only:  
   – Verbatim quote (1-2 lines if crucial)  
   – “Field-ready answer” (your polished response)  
   – Outstanding question → owner.

🔹 Rebuild the “Tree”  
```
Docs/
  Deal_Knowledge_Base/
    01_Maintenance.md
    02_Gas_Supply.md
    03_Tech_Performance.md
    04_Stock_Delivery.md
    05_Commercial.md
    06_Leads_Pipeline.md
Tools/
  checklists/
    Site_Inspection.xlsx
    AMC_Price_Calc.xlsx
```  
Now every call, deck, or email points to one source-of-truth section.

🔹 Minimum Viable Sales Kit (for in-person)  
• A4 tri-fold brochure (graphics + the five “safe” claims).  
• Site-inspection checklist (tick-box + space for load data).  
• Cost-per-kWh calculator (Excel → mobile-friendly).  
• Stock sheet (live Google Sheet, sales sees real availability).

🔹 Lead-Flow Upgrade  
1. Keep riding referrals (50 % from Shadi) – formalise a finder’s-fee slide.  
2. Replace “10 k emails” with:  
   – 25 key accounts per month pulled from plastics / pharma / hotels.  
   – Intro campaign: LinkedIn voice note + WhatsApp PDF, then push for site visit within 72 hrs.  
3. Capture every touch in a lightweight CRM (Notion table is fine for now: columns = Lead / Source / Stage / Next action / Owner).

🔹 Execution Sequence This Week  
Day 1 – Carve transcript into six Markdown buckets.  
Day 2 – Draft brochure & checklist; share with Munaj for sanity check.  
Day 3 – Build stock sheet synced to warehouse.  
Day 4 – Load first 25 target accounts; request intros from Shadi & Omar.  
Day 5 – Hit the road: 5 site visits scheduled.

Do this and you’ll move from messy notes to a repeatable, face-to-face closing machine. 🤖

You know, this seems very cool. We have an A4 trifold brochure, graphics site inspection checklist that's that one's fair enough. The site inspection checklist is fair enough. Cost per kilowatt hour Excel to mobile friendly is fair. The stock sheet is not going to happen, he said. Leave though. Keep writing referrals for yourself from Shady (I mean, those are going to my sales partner), but that doesn't involve me right? Like, how do I get involved? Not necessarily by just trying to collect those leads. Formalise a finders fee slide. I'm not going to be able to do that. That finds me fired slide. Any commission or finance figure will just be discretionary. I feel. Raise 10k emails with 25 key accounts per month pulled from plastics, farmland, hotels. Intro campaign. We know that it's warm interest, but doesn't mean that I'm going to be the one getting said warm intros if that makes sense. Intro campaign, send a LinkedIn voice (no, no point of WhatsApp PDF). Fair enough. And then push for site visit in 72 hours. Yeah, that's fair enough. Capture every touch point in a lightweight Notion table where I lead source, stage, next action owner. I think we should do it in Google Sheets out of Notion's way easier execution section cover the 6 months. Yeah, so there's 6 markdowns and all this is it really necessary? Like, explain how that would be useful to me because it seems like a lot of extra steps that we might not need to do right now.
