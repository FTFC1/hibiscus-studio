## 🔹 Quick Success Tips

1. **Lead with curiosity** - Ask about their biggest power challenges first
2. **Get specific numbers** - Current spend, outage frequency, production impact
3. **Identify the real decision maker** - Don't waste time with influencers only
4. **Take photos** (with permission) - Site layout, existing equipment, space constraints
5. **Close with next steps** - Never leave without a clear follow-up commitment

The checklist is ready at [`Documents/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/SITE_INSPECTION_CHECKLIST.md`](Documents/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/SITE_INSPECTION_CHECKLIST.md)

**One tactical suggestion:** Since you're near Mega Chicken (major commercial area), this could be a solid manufacturing/commercial lead. Focus on the business case more than technical specs initially.

Good hunting! 🤖

_**User**_

- ROI Calculators would be good for next time. We'll get there
- I still need to request my Biz Dev card. My sales partner had cards so it didn't help ( me not having ) 
- I used my phone instead of note pad. 
- I didn't ask many question, here's what we have from mine nad Munaj's notes:

Amuwo odofin site
1. Agro processing site
2. Cassava factory 
3. High story residential building  (400 houses) 
4. Mikano construction needs to do site inspection, win the bid then subcontract 
5. Medium size machines in the cassava factory, major load will be from housing and processing site 
6. Land size 25 acres 
7. Current load there is 1.6MW, 4 units of 500kva + 2 small units of 50kva

my notes:
*General notes for me getting into Gas Tech*
- dark exhaust (big source of power) look for name of company. Then ask Munaj to ask his guys in Mikano 
- Spend time google maps

*Inspection Notes*
- start end date 
- they hope to kick off Q4. 
- our connect is the person whos employer is an investemnt hosue 
- Data sheet for the machines used 
- Do they want power before construction?
- Is there a gas pipeline nearby? o3 confirmed something will share below) 
- Ideal date they want to start or which quarter: q4 they hope 
- Our contact will come to victoria island to sit with chairman, he’ll Give him what you need to move things quickly 
- 25 acres size


from o3:

🔹 Yes – you’re sitting on a busy pipeline corridor. Two separate underground lines run through, or very close to, Mile 2 / Amuwo-Odofin:
	•	Gaslink “Greater Lagos III” 12-inch natural-gas line
	•	Axis 1 of the project runs Mile 2 → Okokomaiko along the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, supplying factories and estates with piped gas.  ￼
	•	NNPC System 2B 16-inch petroleum-products line (Atlas Cove → Mosimi)
	•	This multi-fuel trunk line crosses the Mile 2–Festac belt on its way from the offshore Atlas Cove jetty to Ejigbo/Mosimi depots. Past vandalism/explosions in Abule-Ado and Satellite Town confirm its presence and risk.  ￼ ￼

🔹 Other large-diameter lines nearby (but not right under you):
	•	Escravos-Lagos Gas Pipeline System (ELPS) ends at Itoki (north-east of Mile 2) and feeds the distribution network mentioned above.  ￼
	•	West African Gas Pipeline (offshore) stays in the ocean until it lands farther east at Lagos Beach Compressor Station, so it doesn’t affect your immediate spot.  ￼

🔹 Safety & planning implications
	1.	Right-of-way limits – NNPC and Gaslink reserve 15-30 m corridors; permanent structures, deep excavations, or boreholes within that band need written clearance.
	2.	High-consequence area – 2020 Abule-Ado blast (~3 km SE) shows how ruptures spread far; treat any digging or pile-driving with extreme caution.  ￼
	3.	Who to call before you dig –
	•	Gaslink/Oando Lagos Control: +234 (1) 448 9810
	•	NNPC Pipeline & Products Marketing Co. (PPMC) Lagos Zonal Office: 01-793 0914
	•	Lagos State Emergency Management (LASEMA): 767 or 112
	4.	If you need official maps – request a pipeline route-approval sketch from Lagos State Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources; public Google layers intentionally hide exact alignments for security.

🔹 Bottom line

Your blue dot is within a dual-pipeline risk zone (gas + refined fuels). Any construction, hefty drilling or even planting deep-rooted trees should be cleared with the operators first.

## 🔹 Lead Profile Corrected & Anonymized

**Key Updates:**
- ✅ **Lead Value:** ~$1.12M USD turbine package (~₦1.68B) 
- ✅ **Business Model:** Turbine supply + installation (not power generation)
- ✅ **Anonymized:** "Festac Agro-Residential Complex" (no company names/emails)
- ✅ **Files Renamed:** Clean internal reference system

**Commercial Reality Check:**
- 1MW ≈ $700k USD × 1.6MW = ~$1.12M turbine package
- You supply equipment, partner handles power generation
- Much cleaner revenue model vs operational complexity

**Files Updated:**
- [`Database/ACTIVE_LEADS/Festac_Agro_Residential_Complex.md`](Database/ACTIVE_LEADS/Festac_Agro_Residential_Complex.md)

## 🔹 All Corrections Applied!

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ **1.6MW** (not 2MW) - corrected throughout
- ✅ **Meeting not scheduled yet** - "to be scheduled" status
- ✅ **~$700k USD approx** - added approximation qualifier
- ✅ **Fresh next actions doc** - [`Documents/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/FESTAC_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`](Documents/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/FESTAC_NEXT_ACTIONS.md)
- ✅ **File cleanup** - removed duplicates and old versions

**Key Updates:**
- Lead value: ~$1.12M USD turbine package (~₦1.68B approx)
- Actual demand: 1.6MW (existing gens are just backup capacity)
- Chairman meeting: To be scheduled at Victoria Island
- Business model: Turbine supply + installation (clean revenue)

**Next Actions Ready:**
Your fresh action plan focuses on the critical path - getting technical specs, scheduling that chairman meeting, and preparing the turbine package proposal.

This is still a massive opportunity worth pursuing aggressively! 🤖

version 2 of followup ( for you to write better and do version 3 un the @FESTAC_NEXT_ACTIONS.md ( because there's a chance mikano construction could get in on the deal too ) 

Dear Mr Rotimi,

Thank you for the productive site visit at your Festac Road development today. The 25-acre mixed agro-processing and residential project presents an excellent opportunity for our turbine and potentially also construction solutions.

To prepare the optimal proposal for upcoming meeting with our Chairman meeting, kindly provide the following:

Technical Requirements:
1. Cassava processing equipment specifications and power ratings
2. Expected load profiles for both residential and processing operations
3. Construction timeline and phased development schedule

Commercial Planning:
1. Preferred time and date for chairman meeting
2. Decision-making process and criteria
3. Budget considerations and procurement approach

Our preliminary assessment shows excellent gas pipeline infrastructure access, which significantly reduces installation complexity and cost.

Could we schedule a brief call this week to discuss these details?

Best regards,

MEssage i sent munaj: 

Draft below, FYI can we triple check that there is an existing gas line via MD or someone?

message from munaj:

Power: Selling minimum of 2 units of 1.1MW MTU engines and 11/33KV transformers
LHCV: The project construction phase would require Wheel loaders and excavators while the warehouse phase would require forklifts, we could also place orders for equipment we do not have in stock and have enough time for them to arrive because the PM is working with us and he's in charge of raising the funds for the project
MPSD: The residential and industrial aspect of the project would require breakers, switches, sockets, lighting and all the other products we have
Construction: We would be able to use Mikano construction to be awarded the project bid then subcontract where necessary, this wo uld be useful because the project value will exceed $20,000,000 and it would enable us to win bids in Senegal and Guinea because those tenders require Mikano to have been involved in construction projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars.


NOTE, His points are feedback on the message to Rotimi because I am drafting it with him before sending it off.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀

🔹 **What’s Done**
1. Added a pipeline-verification task.
2. Built Version 4 of the follow-up email that:
   • Offers 2 × 1.1 MW MTU engines (2.2 MW total).  
   • Mentions construction, heavy-equipment, and MPSD scope.  
   • Promises MD-level confirmation of the gas lines.  
3. File updated & committed → `Documents/ACTIVE_STRATEGY/FESTAC_NEXT_ACTIONS.md`

🔹 **Quick Reply to Munaj (copy/paste)**
```
Great inputs, thanks.

• I’ve revised the draft to include 2 × 1.1 MW MTU, construction, LHCV and MPSD scope.
• Added a note that MD will confirm the dual-pipeline route so we’re bullet-proof on fuel.
Let me know if you want any tweaks before I hit send.
```

🔹 **Immediate Next Steps**
1. MD/Engineering desk to **confirm Gaslink + NNPC line** (aim for written note).
2. Final-check the email wording with Munaj, then send to Mr Rotimi.
3. Book that 15-min call slot once email goes out.

That positions us perfectly to lock the Chairman meeting. 🤖
