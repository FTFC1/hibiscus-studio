# Proposal discussion for agro-processing project (2025-06-19 13:36:49)

_**User**_

Latest draft email: 

Dear Mr Rotimi,

Thank you for hosting us at your Festac Road site. Your 25-acre agro-processing and residential programme is an ideal match for Mikano's full-spectrum offering:

• Power: twin 1.1 MW MTU gas engines (2.2 MW total) with 11/33 kV step-up transformers  
• Construction: turnkey design-build management with selective subcontracting  
• Heavy Equipment: wheel loaders & excavators for site works; forklifts for warehouse ops  
• Electrical Products (MPSD): breakers, switches, lighting & distribution panels for both factory and housing

To assemble a proposal we would appreciate a few clarifications:

Technical
1. Cassava-line machinery data sheets (rated kW and duty cycles)  
2. Anticipated peak/average loads for the housing estate and factory  
3. Civil & MEP build schedule (including any temporary power during construction)

Commercial
1. Preferred week for the Chairman presentation  
2. Key stakeholders who should attend  
3. Procurement route under consideration (EPC, EPC+Finance, lease) and indicative budget

Our preliminary study indicates two trunk gas pipelines within reach of the site, keeping tie-in cost and lead-time low. We'll provide formal confirmation once our internal team completes the verification.

Could we arrange a short call this week to review the above and lock in a date for the Chairman session?

Kind regards,
[Your Name]

Comments from sales partner: 

We can close it at any time for any story. Product value: 20 Million dollars. It's more than it was, plus because we were saying the cost, plus the power, plus the construction. It's just an approximate, like we're going to get the actual thing, we can remove that as a problem. 20 millions unrealistic, okay, let's make it 10. So Potential project value: 10 million dollars. Two units of 1.1 megawatts to start, that value would give us 1.3 million dollars at 650 per unit. 1.3 million dollars.

Nifo: Nice cardigan, bro. What time are we praying? I'm not letting you guys waste my time. No, you guys decide to pray by 2:30, you guys pray whenever. Everybody remember. So, 1.3 million dollars for two engines, what else do we have, what can we sell? Forklift, excavator. If Meccano construction will be in charge of the project, we can't sell that, we can't sell an excavator, we will have to use our excavator, okay, but we would build for more than the value of two excavators construction, we can sell them. Let's say two forklifts, let's even say three forklifts, because they look like they have three warehouses there. Three forklifts, one per warehouse, each forklift is how much? Okay, 38 million, 38 million, 600 times three, divided by, that's only 72 thousand dollars. One hundred thousand dollars, what else? MPSD, MPSD products, let's say 1 million dollars for them, that puts us at 2.4 million dollars.

Um, can we provide so this 2.4 is where construction is not, no construction, excavators, so what about lighting, MPSD? The email that I sent you yesterday, what did I even put? Yeah, I think you've already covered because that was always added to make that document. Let's say construction, or before that, let's say synchronization. Synchronization, cabling, and installation, we can give that one. Um, to be modest, let's say 500 million naira, 500 million naira, three hundred thousand dollars. Three hundred thousand dollars, all this is an estimate, that puts us at 2.6 million, 2.7 million dollars. And then what else? So the construction, we can, we can give the construction two million dollars.

What do you, what do you do? I have a document from the lab, which is all of our products. Against, let's see who else we've been talking. Construction, slash subcontracting, is estimated at two million dollars to be modest. So, all right, that gives us 4.6, and then future expansion, you're saying up to 4 million dollars? Right, right now we're at 4.7 million, known as in the future expansion of the load, yeah, we could increase it depending on the load. Well, let's be modest, let's say you need another 1.5 megawatts. To be modest, 1.5 megawatts, future expansion, 1.5 megawatts, that will give us say 1 million dollars. Still, that gives us six million dollars approximately, yeah, including the expansion. Yeah, six million dollars, there are other things that will be added in later, definitely, but now we don't know them, so we'll use these ones for now.

We did a site visit to an industrial location which wanted to do a plant and a 400 unit plant and a 400 unit residential estate. There are two documents attached, one details the different products sold by the company which intends to, at minimum, sell the gas turbine engines, gas engines. Gas engines, and then what I want you to do is to look at the larger PDF and see what other products could be sold to them. So, for example, lighting equipment, excavators, panel breakers, things like that.

Anyway, in the meantime, but yeah, the email is fine, right, um, on to the second one. So, what's civil and MEP? What's MEP? Build Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing construction. But I guess if we're not talking about construction, it's not needed, but we are. I thought like maybe there's two things here. There's a version that involves mechanical construction where they don't pay for the excavators. So that's to be safe, like mechanical construction can't do anything, okay. So MEP, let's not put any MEP. That's also, we can't, we can't, for example, now we wrote MPSD. We can't write MPSD without him knowing what MPSD means. So just remove it, electrical products, simple.

Do you know what MPSD means? Mechanical products? No, mechanical power solution? Division, division, something like that. That's MPSD. In your response, try to use technical language, but give definitions of any technical terms you've used. We're also using or going off the assumption that mechanical construction will not be involved in this project. Maximum will do is subcontract or we'll use a company that Mechano is friends with. Maximum is subcontracting to a third party that Mechano is already in good relationship with. Yeah, um, 2:30 p.m. Friday meeting with MD Omar Suhail instead of chairman. It only gets to chairman when it's decision-making time, so yeah, Omar has the buffer, okay, Omar is chairman, okay, so key stakeholders.

Same thing as the 2:30 p.m. meeting tomorrow, in the meeting tomorrow, then they will discuss because he wants Mechano construction to take the project, we probably can't take the project, so they'll find a way to meet in the middle. Okay, so foreign, I'm gonna send you a list of things with the potential, you know, I'll just say one, two, three, so obviously gas generators, main power source, uh, then the IPP. Are we setting up an IPP plan for them? And that's the, that's July, if they can afford to buy the engines by themselves, perfect, um, switch gear and panels, replacing the old for the new. Backup power switching, which one are we looking at? This is, it's looked at the project in terms of, it's looked at this and it's looked at a document that has all of the carriage products and then it's suggesting what we can sell.

So, for example, there's a bullet point here, which is this one. So just giving us like I don't know if we need this detail, um, we're not gonna, we need to find a way to make it short and sweet. These ones can be for us, okay, that's fine. But then whatever we're gonna like, for example, this experience, this for the Senegal project, yeah, we don't need this to be sent to the customer. Okay, so it has no business with the bottom right card, shouldn't be there for yeah, this so what we're doing is for this second version, we're making a one pager or a two pager for the investment, well for the portfolio fund manager. Yeah, to be able to get an overview. Yeah, in a scalable way. Yeah, so the hundred million here, this one is for us and we are using it for our benefit. He doesn't need to, so sponsor is here. I think let's just write good relationship with portfolio manager, you know gas pipeline nearby could significantly reduce fuel costs. Uh, here let's write gas pipeline can be drawn to site.

Okay, because this is already implied. Separate revenue streams for mechanical construction and LHCV and MPSD. Okay, so this is good. So this is good. Equipment assessment, FG Wilson. Yeah, replace Caterpillar. Yep, replace indoor generator. Which one is the indoor generator? Was there an indoor generator there besides the four and then the 150 kV? Okay, so indoor generator, let's remove it. Yeah, we didn't see, we didn't see it there, the um container generator, we'll call it backup generator, JMG 50 KVA instead of 500. So it's irrelevant for the project. The 50 KV, it's only there now probably because they're not operational and they need to use something to have light.

Okay, what they're doing. Some extra context for you, so the forklift is high and low. Yeah, the Maxis is, um, the Maxis is the T60, Maxis is also the C300s, and all of these you can see in the item description. That's what I'm looking at in order to pick these, you will also notice that if the item code does not start with FGM, it will not be an actual vehicle and it will be like a spare part or something. That's what I see means.

So what you'll also notice is in your current, uh report generator success. We have total vehicles. You have changing vehicles. You have Maxis vehicles. You have unique bins, but you do not have cards or call out cards for the other brands. But move indoor generator, we don't need it there. Yeah, so this is in the equipment assessment, the backup JMG. We don't know how old it is, 50 KV. I didn't look at the specs for the as in 50 KV instead of a 500. Yeah, it's a small engine. Okay, 50 KV because these ones are 500, this one is only 50, okay. So this means this is the container generator, the small JMG engine that was there. Okay, and then main switch. This is the transformer, right? What's happening? Was that the brand? No, the model was there? Long and Crawford is the brand, RMU. What is RMU? Um, RMU, ring main unit, in electrical power distribution, is a type of compact modular switch gear used in medium voltage power distribution.

All right, let's just call it transformer, we don't need to call it main switch. Okay, Long and Crawford. GE, is that General Electric? Yeah, it would be General Electric, but we can remove that and just say Long and Crawford. Yeah, 630 amps, 11 KV. Okay, so 630 A slash 11 KV, 11 KV. High priority risks, main switch unit is 60 plus years old, could fail at any time. Definitely, everything that will be power-related, there will be replaced. So it's not even a question, everything will be replaced if it's going to be power-related. Roof railings badly rusted, fall hazard, uh gas pipeline, do you want to remove it? Roof railings? Yeah, you don't need it. Okay, let's just focus on the power first. After the meeting, then we'll know if we'll be interested in the construction if Omar will have a company to do it.

So, so here major opportunities, forget that's my plan. Um, that's my plan is a necessity for power. So first one, let's put uh project size means project size will enable us to sell multiple units of the 1.1 megawatts. That's the first one. Second one, this one is perfect. Sponsor's portfolio opens those two more projects. Perfect. Medium priority, transformer oil needs testing, could be transformer will be changing. Okay, so we're removing the medium priority one. Are there any other things that you think are medium priority? Because right now, what that means is that high priority is just going to have the main switch unit is 60 plus years old. The major opportunities are the ones you just said and we're removing the medium price.

So from medium priority, um, we can organize a site inspection with relevant divisions to do a BOP, wait, you're doing the next action. It's not medium priority. Well, yeah. Okay, cool. So then so one of the next actions is to do a second site visit with relevant divisions to get BOP, bill of plants, plant bill of plants. The bill, you know like a VOQ. Yeah, so the project will require like a bill of the whole plants to see what is needed here, what is needed there. How can we, in terms of this one to four? Where does that slide? Um, let it fall under CLAN data, okay. Yeah, so yeah, that's one right, so the other things are good, we just need to add gas survey, let's confirm um gas pipeline source right and contacts NGML, Axella early. To know if they are interested or if they are there already. Mm-hmm, uh urgent replacements, everything. Everything, every you can, should we detail it just so they're not like of course mechanic's gonna urgent replacements, uh power source. Um, 50 KBA. No, that's all power source. Okay, all power source and uh well, they're not gonna be. Does it count as being replaced if new things have to be bought? I mean, yeah, being replaced with new. Yeah, so forklifts as well that will be under the factory once it starts operating.

So we're good, yeah, that's it. That's everything, okay, so it is a new version of this and then a slight change to the email. Yeah, so now we can just let him have it for his own reference. It's not like he's gonna send it to anybody. But he will use it to have an idea of what is on the ground right now and we'll take it from there. So usually like whenever these projects start, they take a long time to mature. Long time, so we're talking minimum one year. When you say mature, isn't to go from the 2.2 to make any significant progress, oh in the actual like yeah, but for me up and running it can take like a month if it's up and running. But now this project is small. Oh, you mean because the buildings aren't there yet. Yeah, if it was a site that was requiring power, it could take one month. You

we also made this:

Thank you for hosting us at the Festac Road site. Your 25-acre cassava-processing and residential development aligns perfectly with Mikano’s integrated offer:

• Power: two MTU 1.1 MW gas engines (2.2 MW total) with 11/33 kV step-up transformers (increase voltage for efficient distribution)  
• Electrical products: medium-voltage switchgear / RMUs* and low-voltage distribution panels & lighting  
• Material-handling: three diesel forklifts for warehouse operations  
• Scalability: provision for an extra ~1.5 MW as demand grows

To prepare a board-ready proposal we need:

Technical  
1. Cassava-line machinery datasheets (rated kW & duty cycles)  
2. Expected peak/average loads for factory and estate  
3. Civil build schedule, including any temporary construction power

Commercial  
1. Preferred week for your MD, Mr Omar Suhail, to review the proposal (we have 14:30 Friday pencilled in)  
2. Stakeholders who should attend  
3. Procurement route under consideration (outright purchase, EPC + finance, or lease) and indicative budget

Our preliminary survey shows two trunk gas pipelines within ~200 m of the site, likely keeping tie-in cost and lead-time low. We will confirm pressure and connection rights once our energy desk completes its checks.

Could we schedule a 10-minute call this week to discuss the above and lock the meeting date?

Kind regards,
