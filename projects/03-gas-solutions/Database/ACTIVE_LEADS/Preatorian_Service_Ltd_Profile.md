**Timeline:** Q4 2024 kick-off target  

### Key Components:
1. **Cassava Processing Factory** - Medium-size machinery
2. **High-rise Residential** - 400 housing units  
3. **Current Power Demand:** 1.6MW
   - 4 units × 500kVA = 2MW capacity

## 🔹 Technical Assessment

**Current Infrastructure:**
- Load: 1.6MW active demand
- Backup: 4×500kVA + 2×50kVA generators
- **Gas Pipeline Access:** ✅ CONFIRMED
  - Gaslink "Greater Lagos III" 12-inch line nearby
  - NNPC System 2B 16-inch line in corridor
  - Pipeline corridor safety considerations apply

**Site Characteristics:**
- 25-acre development site
- Mixed industrial/residential load profile
- Agro-processing equipment (data sheets needed)

## 🔹 Commercial Opportunity

**Revenue Potential:** HIGH
- 1.6MW turbine package = ~$1.12M USD (~₦1.68B)
- Turbine supply + installation contract
- Construction integration opportunity
- Third-party power supply partnership model

**Timeline Factors:**
- Q4 2024 construction start target
- Power needed before/during construction phase
- Chairman meeting = fast-track decision potential

## 🔹 Critical Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week):
1. **Machine Data Sheets** - Request from contact
2. **Pre-construction Power Needs** - Clarify requirements
