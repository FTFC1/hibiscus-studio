  MISSION 1: THE 5-30-60 RULE
  ⏱️ 2 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
Customer walks in. You're restocking.
By the time you look up → they've
browsed alone → checked prices → left.

Cost: ₦15.6M/year from ungreeted customers.

THE RULE
  ⚡ 5 sec   Eye contact + smile
  👋 30 sec  Approach if browsing
  🎯 60 sec  Approach NO MATTER WHAT

WHAT TO SAY
  ❌ "Can I help you?" → "No" 90% of time
  ✅ "What brings you in today?"
  ✅ "Looking for something specific
     or just seeing what's new?"
  ✅ "That's one of our most popular
     — want to try it on?"

IF "JUST LOOKING"
  "No problem — I'm [Name], come find
   me if you need anything."
  Stay visible. Check back in 3-4 min.

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Acknowledge every customer in 5 sec
  □ Approach 80%+ within 60 sec
  □ Kill "can I help you?" from vocab
  □ Count greetings. Beat tomorrow.

═══════════════════════════════════════
  ₦300K/week lost when you skip this.
  Free when you don't.

  MISSION 2: KILL "CAN I HELP YOU?"
  ⏱️ 2 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
"Can I help you?" → "No thanks, just
looking" → conversation dead.
It's a closed question. 90% get shut
down with one word.

Cost: ₦6.5M/year from wrong openers.

5 WARM OPENINGS THAT WORK

  1. THE OCCASION
     "What brings you in today?"
     → Open-ended. Invites their story.

  2. THE CHOICE FRAME
     "Looking for something specific,
      or just seeing what's new?"
     → Two options. No "no" escape.

  3. THE PRODUCT HOOK
     "That's one of our most popular —
      [feature] is what people love.
      Want to try it on?"
     → Info + action. Not asking permission.

  4. THE SELF/GIFT
     "Shopping for yourself or a gift?"
     → Everyone is one or the other.

  5. THE COMPLIMENT BRIDGE
     "I love those [item you're wearing]
      — looking for similar or different?"
     → Rapport + choice. Not yes/no.

IF THEY STILL SAY "JUST LOOKING"
  "No problem — I'm [Name]. Grab me
   if you need anything."
  Check back in 3-4 min:
  "Found anything you like?"

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Pick ONE opening. Use it ALL DAY.
  □ Count: how many engage vs shut down?
  □ Goal: 60%+ engagement rate
  □ Try different opening tomorrow.

═══════════════════════════════════════
  One question change = ₦6.5M/year
  difference. Pick one. Master it.

═══════════════════════════════════════
  MISSION 3: THE 70/30 RULE
  ⏱️ 2 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
Customer says "running shoes." You show
5 options, talk about NITRO foam, PWRPLATE,
new colorway, breathability...
Eyes glaze → "Let me think about it" → gone.

That's feature-dumping. You talked AT
them, not WITH them.

Cost: ₦3.9M/year from not listening.

THE RULE
  Customer talks: 70%
  You talk: 30%

If you're doing most of the talking,
you're doing it wrong.

THE 4 QUESTIONS (ask BEFORE showing product)

  Q1. OCCASION — "What are you buying for?"
      Dig deeper than "shoes." WHY today?

  Q2. PROBLEM — "What's not working now?"
      Everyone's here because something
      isn't working. Find it.

  Q3. PRIORITY — "What matters most —
      comfort, durability, or style?"
      This tells you how to frame it.

  Q4. DECISION — "Hoping to leave with
      something today?"
      Buying now or researching?

THEN recommend based on what you heard.
Connect features to THEIR specific needs.

EXAMPLE (GOOD)
  "Running shoes."
  → "What kind of running?"
  → "Just starting. Knees hurt."
  → "So comfort over speed right now?"
  → "Yeah, exactly."
  → Show 2 cushioned options. Done.

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Pick 3 customers. Go deep with 4 Qs.
  □ Only show product AFTER all 4 asked.
  □ End of day: did asking more = better
    recommendations?

═══════════════════════════════════════
  Routine beats knowledge.
  Ask first, show second.
═══════════════════════════════════════


═══════════════════════════════════════
  MISSION 4: "I'LL THINK ABOUT IT"
  ⏱️ 3 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
You did everything right. Customer seems
interested. Then: "Let me think about it."
9 out of 10 never come back.

Cost: ₦31.2M/year walking out the door.

WHAT IT REALLY MEANS
  1. "Not sure it's worth the price"
  2. "Need to ask someone" (spouse, parent)
  3. "Something's off but I'm being polite"
  4. "Want to compare prices elsewhere"
  5. "You pressured me — escaping now"

THE 3-STEP FRAMEWORK

  STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE
  "That's totally fair. Can I ask —
   what's making you want to think
   it over?"

  STEP 2: PROBE
  If vague, offer specific guesses:
  → "Is it the price, or not sure
     it's the right fit?"
  → "Need to check with someone?"
  → "Is something not quite what
     you're looking for?"

  STEP 3: BRIDGE (to smaller action)
  Don't push for sale. Offer help:
  → Show an alternative
  → "Want me to hold it for 24hrs?"
  → "Take a photo to show them"
  → "Here's my card — text me"

EXAMPLE
  "Let me think about it."
  → "Totally fair. Is it the price?"
  → "Yeah... ₦35K is more than I planned."
  → "What were you thinking?"
  → "Around ₦25K."
  → "Got it. I have something at ₦28K
     that still has [key feature].
     Want to see?"
  → "Sure, let's look."

  Sale saved. No discount needed.

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Use 3-step framework on 3 customers
  □ Discover the REAL reason (not surface)
  □ Bridge to smaller action, not hard close
  □ If they say it twice → let go gracefully.
    Give card, smile, let them leave.

═══════════════════════════════════════
  "I'll think about it" is a door,
  not a dead end. Open it gently.
═══════════════════════════════════════


═══════════════════════════════════════
  MISSION 5: "IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE"
  ⏱️ 3 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
Customer loves it. Sees price tag.
"₦45,000? That's too expensive."
You panic → offer 10% off → they
leave anyway → you lost margin AND sale.

Cost: ₦2.8M/year in unnecessary discounts
+ ₦5M/year when word spreads you'll budge.

WHAT IT REALLY MEANS
  1. "I don't see why it's worth this much"
  2. "More than I planned to spend"
  3. "Can get similar for less elsewhere"
  4. "Testing if you'll give a discount"
  5. "I actually can't afford this"

THE 4-STEP FRAMEWORK

  STEP 1: ASK ABOUT BUDGET
  "I hear you. What were you thinking
   price-wise?"
  → Now you know what you're working with.

  STEP 2: ANCHOR THE VALUE
  "The reason this is ₦45K instead of
   ₦25K is [benefit tied to THEIR need].
   You mentioned [their problem] — this
   solves that. The cheaper version doesn't."

  Key: connect price to THEIR specific
  use case. Not brand talk. Not features.

  STEP 3: SHOW THE CHEAPER OPTION
  "Want to see the ₦25K version? I'll
   show you both side by side."
  → Let them feel the difference.
  → Seeing the downgrade often sells
    the upgrade.

  STEP 4: PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY
  "We have installments — ₦15K today,
   ₦15K next month, ₦15K after."
  Or cost per use: "₦45K ÷ 200 wears =
   ₦225/wear. Less than a bottle of water."

NEVER DO THIS
  ❌ Discount immediately (trains them)
  ❌ "But it's really good quality!" (defensive)
  ❌ "It's PUMA, of course it costs that"
  ❌ Trash cheaper alternatives (personal)
  ❌ Brand history lecture (boring)

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Use 4-step framework on 3 price
    objections today
  □ Try the "show down" comparison at
    least once
  □ Track: how many held full price?
  □ Never discount before trying all 4 steps

═══════════════════════════════════════
  Price objections are buying signals.
  They wouldn't mention price if they'd
  already decided not to buy.
═══════════════════════════════════════


═══════════════════════════════════════
  MISSION 6: EXIT PROTOCOL
  ⏱️ 3 min read
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE PROBLEM
Customer spent 20 min with you. Did
everything right. They're leaving anyway.

Most staff: "Okay, thanks!" → gone forever.
60-70% of browsers don't buy first visit.
But 30-40% would buy later IF you follow up.

Cost: ₦31.2M/year in recoverable sales
lost by not capturing leads.

THE EXIT PROTOCOL (4 steps)

  STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE (no pressure)
  "No problem! Before you go — can I
   grab your name and number? If we get
   new stock or this goes on sale,
   I'll let you know."

  STEP 2: CAPTURE KEY INFO
  □ Name (first name enough)
  □ Phone number (WhatsApp best)
  □ What they wanted (running shoes, etc.)
  □ Why they didn't buy (budget, size, etc.)
  → Write it down IMMEDIATELY.

  STEP 3: SET EXPECTATIONS
  "I'll text you if [specific trigger]
   in the next [timeframe]. If you don't
   hear from me, nothing came up — but
   reach out anytime."

  Triggers:
  → "...if these go on sale"
  → "...when size 43 comes in"
  → "...if something in your budget arrives"

  STEP 4: WARM EXIT
  "I'm [Name], by the way.
   Nice meeting you!"
  → Personal. Not transactional.

FOLLOW-UP RULES
  ✅ Text within 3-7 days if trigger hits
  ✅ One follow-up max if no response
  ✅ Personalise: name, item, size, price
  ❌ Don't spam (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3 = blocked)
  ❌ Don't follow up after 2 weeks (cold)
  ❌ Don't capture from 30-sec browsers
     (only 5+ min warm leads)

TEXT TEMPLATES
  Sale: "Hi [name]! [You] from [store].
   Those [item] are on sale — [price].
   Want me to hold one?"

  Restock: "Hi [name], those [item] in
   [size] just came back. Set one aside?"

  Check-in: "Hey [name], still looking
   for [item]? Let me know if I can help!"

TODAY'S PRACTICE
  □ Capture info from 3 non-buyers
  □ Use the full 4-step protocol
  □ Set specific triggers for each
  □ Follow up when trigger happens

═══════════════════════════════════════
  2 recovered sales/week = ₦2.6M/year.
  From one text message each.
