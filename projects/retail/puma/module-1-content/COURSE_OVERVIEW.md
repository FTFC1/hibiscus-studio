## Why This Works

### Based on Real Retail Research
Every mission uses insights from actual retail staff at Nike, Adidas, Ash Luxury, and multi-brand stores in Nigeria. Not theory—real problems and real solutions.

### Bite-Sized & Actionable
No 2-hour workshops that everyone forgets by Tuesday. 10 minutes/day, one skill at a time, immediate practice.

### Built for Mobile
Staff have smartphones and data. Content is optimized for phone reading during breaks.

### Layer 1 = Reusable
The core 20 missions (Modules 1-3) work for any retail brand. Only Module 4 is PUMA-specific. When we roll this to Lacoste, we just swap Module 4.
