# 🚀 LAUNCH CODE: Retail 360 Layer 1 — Module 1

**Session:** Building Universal Retail Training Content
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Focus:** Write 2000-3000 word markdown lesson

---

## CONTEXT

I'm building Layer 1 (70% reusable) content for a retail training course.

This is the universal content that works for ANY retail brand — clothing, beauty, food service, electronics, luxury goods, etc.

The work that matters is **writing the markdown content**. Everything else (platform, exercises, quizzes) comes after the core content exists.

---

## YOUR TASK

Write **Module 1: Customer Journey Mapping** as a complete 2000-3000 word markdown lesson.

### Content Requirements

**Topic:** Customer Journey Mapping for Retail

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (200 words)
   - Why this matters in retail
   - The cost of not understanding the journey
   - What you'll learn

2. **Core Framework** (800-1200 words)
   - The 5 stages of retail customer journey
   - What happens at each stage
   - Common failure points at each stage
   - How to map your specific store's journey

3. **Practical Application** (600-800 words)
   - Step-by-step walkthrough
   - Real retail examples (anonymized, multiple sectors)
   - How to identify your weak points
   - How to fix them

4. **Implementation** (200-300 words)
   - What to do this week
   - How to measure if it's working
   - Next steps

### Writing Principles

**DO:**
- Write like you're training someone in person
- Use retail examples from multiple sectors (clothing, food, beauty, electronics)
- Make it actionable within 1 week
- Include specific failure modes and how to spot them
- Reference real behavior patterns (customers browsing, staff interrupting, etc.)

**DON'T:**
- Use brand names (Nike, Starbucks, etc.)
- Make it theory-heavy (keep it practical)
- Assume any prior knowledge
- Write generic advice that could apply to any industry

### Quality Bar

This content should pass the **4 tests:**
1. Portfolio-worthy (shows expertise)
2. Never do again (reusable for any retail brand)
3. Leverage (can be used 100x)
4. Shippable today (complete, not draft)

## START SIGNAL

When I say "BEGIN MODULE 1" in the next message, write the complete module.

Write as if this is going live to 100 retail stores today. Make it complete, not a prototype.

No need to ask clarifying questions. Write the best universal retail customer journey content you can.
