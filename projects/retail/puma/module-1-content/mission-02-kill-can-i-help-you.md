# Mission 2: Kill "Can I Help You?"

**⏱️ Time:** 6-8 minutes
**🎯 What you'll learn:** The exact openings that invite conversation instead of getting shut down

---

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

You've nailed the 5-30-60 Rule from yesterday. You're acknowledging customers quickly. You're approaching within 60 seconds.

But then you say: **"Can I help you?"**

And they say: **"No thanks, just looking."**

Now what? You tried. They rejected you. You walk away. They browse alone. They leave without buying.

This happens to retail staff **hundreds of times per week.** And most don't realize it's not their fault—it's the question.

"Can I help you?" is the worst opening in retail. Here's why.

## 💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES

### The Problem with "Can I Help You?"

It's a **closed question** — meaning customers can (and will) shut it down with one word: "No."

But here's the deeper issue: when you ask "Can I help you?", you're asking them to:
1. Admit they need help (feels vulnerable)
2. Commit to engaging with you (feels like pressure)
3. Make a decision about you in 0.5 seconds (they don't know you yet)

Most people's default response to strangers asking for commitment? **"No thanks."**

Not because they don't need help. Not because they're not interested. But because **saying no is easier than saying yes to a stranger.**

### What Happens After "Just Looking"

Once a customer says "just looking," three bad things happen:

**1. They've built a wall** — They've already told you they don't want help. Now if they need something later, they feel awkward coming back to you (because they said no).

**2. You feel rejected** — It stings a little. Do that 10-20 times a day, and you start avoiding customers entirely. Why bother if they're just going to say no?

**3. The sale dies before it starts** — They browse alone, don't find what they need, leave. You had 30 seconds of interaction. Total.

A Nike manager described this exact problem:

> "There's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff go about making their sales. It's quite detrimental... it leads to a lot of lost sales."

**Real cost calculation:**
- 5 sales killed/week by "Can I help you?"
- 5 sales × ₦25,000 average basket = **₦125,000/week lost**
- ₦125,000/week × 52 weeks = **₦6.5 million/year lost**

Just from using the wrong opening question.

## ✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

### The 5 Warm Openings That Work

**🎯 Opening 1: The Occasion Question**

"What brings you in today?"

**Why it works:** Open-ended. Invites them to explain their need. Feels conversational, not salesy.

**Example dialogue:**
- You: "Hey! What brings you in today?"
- Customer: "Just looking for running shoes."
- You: "Nice—what kind of running do you do?"

Now you're in. They're talking. You're learning.

---

**🎯 Opening 2: The Choice Frame**

"Are you looking for something specific, or just seeing what's new?"

**Why it works:** Gives them two options (both involve engagement). No "no" option.

**Example dialogue:**
- You: "Are you looking for something specific, or just seeing what's new?"
- Customer: "Just seeing what you have."
- You: "Cool—we just got some new arrivals this week. What style do you usually go for?"

---

**🎯 Opening 3: The Product Hook**

(When they're looking at something)

"That [item] is one of our most popular—[specific feature] is what people love about it. Want to try it on?"

**Why it works:** You're giving them useful information + inviting action. Not asking if they need help.

**Example dialogue:**
- You: "That Suede Classic is one of our best sellers—super versatile, goes with everything. What size are you?"
- Customer: "10."
- You: "Let me grab you a 10 to try."

---

**🎯 Opening 4: The Self/Gift Question**

"Are you shopping for yourself or looking for a gift?"

**Why it works:** Everyone is doing one or the other. Forces them to engage.

**Example dialogue:**
- You: "Are you shopping for yourself or a gift?"
- Customer: "Gift for my brother."
- You: "Nice! What's the occasion? Birthday?"

Now you know exactly what they need. (Gift, male, occasion = birthday, probably needs packaging, maybe card, etc.)

---

**🎯 Opening 5: The Compliment Bridge**

(If they're wearing something you can compliment)

"I love those [shoes/jacket/whatever]—are you looking for something similar or something totally different?"

**Why it works:** Compliments build instant rapport. Then you're giving them a choice between two paths, not yes/no.

**Example dialogue:**
- You: "Those RS-Xs are clean—are you looking for more sneakers or something different today?"
- Customer: "More sneakers, yeah."
- You: "What's your style—classic or the new stuff?"

## 🎭 REAL EXAMPLE: How Luxury Retail Does It

A high-end retail manager described their approach with high-profile clients:

> "We make them feel special. If they're well-known, we do quick research—check what they've been up to recently. Then we reference that in the conversation."

Then they open with context:

- "Congratulations on [recent achievement]. You probably have a lot of events coming up—let me show you some options."

**The lesson:** Even with regular customers, **personalization beats generic greetings.** If you remember them from before, if you know what they bought last time, if you noticed something about them—use it.

"Welcome back! How are those shoes we got you last month?"

That's 100x better than "Can I help you?"

## 🚧 WHAT IF THEY STILL SAY "JUST LOOKING"?

Even with warm openings, sometimes people say "just browsing" or "just looking."

Here's your response:

**"No problem at all—I'll be right over here. My name's [X]. Come grab me if you need anything or have questions."**

Then:
1. **Stay visible** (don't disappear)
2. **Check back in 3-4 minutes:** "How are you doing? Found anything interesting?"

The second approach almost always goes better than the first. They've had time to browse, they're more comfortable, and now they might actually need help.

## 🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY

**Pick ONE opening to use all day today.** Seriously—just one. Master it before trying the others.

**My recommendation:** Start with "What brings you in today?"

It's simple. It's natural. It works.

**Your checklist:**
1. ✅ Every customer you approach: use your chosen opening
2. ✅ If they give a short answer, ask a follow-up: "What kind of [X] are you looking for?"
3. ✅ Count how many customers engage vs. say "just looking"
4. ✅ End of day: Write down the percentage. (Example: 8 out of 10 engaged = 80%)

**Goal:** Get 60%+ engagement (they start talking, not shutting you down).

---

## 📊 MEASURING SUCCESS

By the end of this week, you should:
- ✅ Hear "just looking" **less than 40%** of the time
- ✅ Have at least **3 warm openings** you're comfortable using
- ✅ Feel less rejected when approaching customers (because they're engaging more)

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS WORKS

Customers aren't saying "just looking" because they don't want help. They're saying it because:
- You're asking the wrong question
- They feel pressured by yes/no questions
- They don't trust you yet

Warm openings bypass all of that. You're not asking for permission to help. You're starting a **conversation** about what they need.

That's what changes everything.

---

## 🔥 ADVANCED TIP: The Assumption Close

Once you're good with warm openings, try this:

Instead of asking "Want to try it on?", say:
**"Let me grab your size—what are you, a [size]?"**

You're assuming the yes. Most people go along with it.

(Only works if they're clearly interested. Don't force it.)

## ➡️ TOMORROW: Mission 3 — The 70/30 Rule

You're greeting customers well. You're opening conversations. But are you **listening**?

Tomorrow we'll cover the 70/30 Rule: the customer should be talking 70% of the time, you 30%. If you're doing most of the talking, you're doing it wrong.

See you tomorrow.

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE: The 5 Warm Openings

(Save this - you'll reference it in your practice today)

1. **"What brings you in today?"**

**💡 Quick Tip:** If a customer gives you a one-word answer and turns away, they want space. Don't push. Say "Cool, I'll be right over here if you need me" and give them 5 minutes. Then check back.
