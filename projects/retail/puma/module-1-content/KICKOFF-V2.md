# 🚀 LAUNCH CODE: Retail 360 Layer 1 — Module 1

**Reference Quality:** AI Frontrunners course level
**Session:** Building Universal Retail Training Content
**Date:** 2026-01-27

## THE BAR

Look at `/00_Inbox/EP Course/ai-frontrunners-gpt/`

That's the quality bar. That's what real course content looks like.

**What they did right:**
- Conversational, direct language ("Most people printing with this stuff don't understand it either")
- Brutally honest ("The uncomfortable truth is that info is actually harder to sell")
- Practical focus ("No unnecessary BS. No pointless tech")
- Natural structure, not rigid academic format
- Interactive lesson formats with coaching flows
- 8,000-18,000 words per module (their modules are 30-70KB)
- Multiple lessons per module with clear chapter breaks

**What my first prompt got wrong:**
- Too prescriptive ("Hook: 200 words")
- Too short (2000-3000 words is a blog post, not a module)
- Too academic and structured
- Missing the conversational tone
- No interactive elements

## YOUR REAL TASK

Write Module 1 of Retail 360 at the same quality level as AI Frontrunners.

**Topic:** Customer Journey & In-Store Experience Mastery

This isn't "customer journey mapping" as an abstract exercise. This is the real shit that happens when someone walks into a retail store and either buys or leaves.

### What This Module Covers

**Chapter 1: Introduction**
- Why most retail staff don't understand the customer journey (and why it costs stores thousands)
- What you'll learn in this module
- The uncomfortable truth about retail training

**Chapter 2: The 5 Moments That Make or Break a Sale**
- Pre-entry (they haven't walked in yet)
- Entry & first impression (first 10 seconds)
- Browse & engagement (the danger zone)
- Decision & objection handling (where most sales die)
- Close & exit (the moment that creates returning customers)

For each moment:
- What's actually happening in the customer's head
- Where staff fuck it up (real examples from retail interviews)
- What good looks like
- How to train your team on this

**Chapter 3: Interactive Walkthrough**
- Guided exercise: Map your actual store's customer journey
- Identify your store's weak points
- Fix the top 3 failure modes this week

**Chapter 4: Implementation & Measurement**
- What to do starting Monday
- How to know if it's working
- What comes next

### Writing Principles

**Voice:**
Write like you're talking to a retail manager at 11pm after a long shift. They're tired. They've seen the problems. They want real solutions, not corporate training BS.

**Honesty:**
Don't sugarcoat. If something is hard, say it's hard. If most stores fail at something, explain why.

**Examples:**
Use real patterns from the retail interviews in `2_Areas/02-Retail/1_FOUNDATION/Research/INTERVIEWS/`:
- Ifeoma (Adidas)
- Kieran Murphy
- Seyi Falodun
- Uzomaka (Ash Luxury)
- The retail sales staff interviews (part 1 & 2)

Pull real failure modes, real customer behaviors, real staff frustrations.

**Length:**
Write until the module is complete. Could be 8,000 words. Could be 15,000. Don't count words, just make it comprehensive.

### Quality Checks

Before you're done, ask:
1. Would a retail manager read this at midnight and think "finally, someone gets it"?
2. Does it use real examples from real retail environments?
3. Is it actionable this week, not "someday"?
4. Does it pass the 4 tests (portfolio, never again, leverage, ship)?

## START SIGNAL

When I paste this into a new Claude chat and say "BEGIN MODULE 1", write the complete module at AI Frontrunners quality level.

No asking clarifying questions. Just write the best retail training content that exists.

Ready.
