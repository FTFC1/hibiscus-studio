## The 4 Tests for "DONE"

Each module passes when:
- [1] Portfolio Test → Could you show this to prove capability?
- [2] Never Again Test → Is it documented/systematic to reuse?
- [3] Leverage Test → Are there reusable components?
- [4] Ship + Write Test → Can you ship it and write it as a case study?

## Platform Decision (PENDING)

Options being considered:
- Whop (courses, payment, dashboard) — not yet researched
- Telegram group + Craft MCP — familiar, low friction
- Other

**Decision:** TBD after Module 1 is written

**Principle:** Content first. Distribution second.
