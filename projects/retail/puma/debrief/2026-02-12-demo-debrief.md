---

## Participants & Roles

| Person | Role | Energy | Key Contribution |
|--------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Nicholas (FT)** | Presenter | Led demo confidently | Showed all 3 games, lessons, quiz, Telegram community |
| **Timmy** | Commercial lead | HIGH — set up meeting, framed context well | Gave business background, handled room, translated for team |
| **Adedolapo** | Sales & Ops | ENGAGED — asked detailed questions | Best product feedback (Approach = favorite, Basket = confusing) |
| **Molade** | HR | Present | Arrived late, minimal verbal contribution |
| **Peter** | Remote | POSITIVE | Originally raised the cross-selling gap, said "honestly it's a good idea" x2 |
| **Ate** | Operations | PRACTICAL | Suggested scheduled training times (control when RSAs use it) |

---

## What Was Demoed

1. **Customer Says** (Game) — Identify buyer type from what they say
2. **The Approach** (Game) — What to say to each buyer type
3. **Build the Basket** (Game) — Cross-sell: what to add given what they're buying
4. **Lessons** — Mobile-first pages, Puma SKUs ingested, reference material
5. **Quizzes** — Telegram bot, pass gate at 80%, retry built in, wrong → lesson link
6. **Telegram Community** — Screenshot wins, group engagement, tracking
7. **Dashboard concept** — Weekly view: completion, quiz scores, at-risk identification

## Strong Persuasive Moments

- **"Money is leaving the store"** — Framing the problem as lost revenue, not training gap
- **Uber analogy** — "Uber drivers aren't behind a desk. Your salespeople aren't either." Mobile-first justified.
- **80-question bank** — "So people aren't just gaming the system" — answered the cheating concern before it was raised
- **"Change behavior, not just teach"** — Elevated from training to business outcome (AOV increase)
- **"Bespoke offer built on data"** — Positioned the trial feedback loop as the premium differentiator
- **Timmy's framing** — "Normally there's a fee but I'll convince him to waive it" — created perceived value before demo even started

---

## Feedback by Person

### Adedolapo (most detailed feedback)
- **The Approach = FAVORITE** — "I liked that one because he was telling us... give me something for my son's birthday"
- **Build the Basket = CONFUSING** — "a lot of complication" — was clicking randomly at first, had to calm down and read
- **Ambiguous answers** — Some answers aren't wrong, just not optimal. "How do you get graded where it's like, it could be right, it could be wrong, but you're not wrong?"
- **Wants upselling included** — Same product, higher tier. "Can you suggest the premium package?"
- **Product imagery needed** — Wants visual clarity on which products are being discussed

### Peter (remote)
- **"Honestly it's a good idea"** (said twice)
- **Lessons too long** — "If some of the modules can be compressed... 2-3 pages, 5 minutes"
- **Wants simplicity** — "Something they can easily go through"
- **Warned:** "Before we knew, they'll start complaining that the module is too much"

### Ate (Operations)
- **Scheduling concern** — "We might want to control it... give them specific training days, like Wednesday morning, all of you go on phones"
- **Overall positive** — "Quite interesting... I liked the customer [says game]"

### Timmy (throughout)
- Acted as translator between Nicholas and room
- Jumped in to explain game mechanics (HIIT example)
- Handled logistics framing (onboarding next week, 6-week trial)

## Decisions Made

| # | Decision | By |
|---|----------|----|
| 1 | Trial at Palms/Lekki store, 6-7 weeks | Timmy + room consensus |
| 2 | Trial fee waived | Timmy (pre-negotiated with Nicholas) |
| 3 | Physical onboarding needed — get RSAs on Telegram | Timmy |
| 4 | Reports end-of-day + end-of-week (not real-time dashboard) | Nicholas |
| 5 | Full rollout decision after trial results | Room |
| 6 | Feedback to be incorporated before production | Nicholas |

## Business Logic Needed from PRL

| What | Why | Urgency |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Upsell matrix** — product → correct upsell (priority 1, priority 2) | Build the Basket game needs grading logic | Before trial or as trial runs |
| **Right/wrong scoring rules** — when an answer is "not wrong but not optimal" | Adedolapo's question about ambiguous grading | Before trial |
| **Store-specific product context** — which products are strategic priorities | Allows training to align with business goals | Medium |
| **Success KPIs** — what metrics would prove trial worked | Needed for trial evaluation | Before trial starts |
| **RSA list** — who specifically will be in the trial | Onboarding logistics | Next week |

---

## Missed Opportunities

- **No specific onboarding date locked** — "maybe next week" but no day confirmed
- **No success criteria defined** — What does PRL consider a successful trial? (UPT increase? Quiz scores? Engagement rate?)
- **Peter's lesson length feedback not fully addressed** — Nicholas explained games > lessons but could have committed to shorter lessons
- **No ask for the upsell matrix** — The conversation surfaced the need but no action item was assigned to PRL
- **Demo flow was out of order** — Showed games first, then lessons, then quiz. The actual user flow (lesson → quiz → game) would have been more intuitive
- **Dashboard was shown as concept not reality** — Could have set clearer expectations for trial reporting

---

## Nicholas's Performance Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Confident delivery, let the product speak
- Good technical explanations without jargon
- Handled objections well ("we need your business logic first")
- Positioned premium (bespoke, data-driven) without overselling
- Smart analogies (Uber, behavior change vs teaching)

**Areas to improve:**
- **Close harder** — Could have asked "So can we aim for Monday for onboarding?" instead of leaving it open
- **Assign homework** — "Can someone send me the upsell matrix by Thursday?"
- **Read the room better** — Adedolapo was giving product feedback in real-time, could have engaged more deeply
- **Demo sequencing** — Lead with the user journey, not the most interesting feature
- **Energy matching** — Timmy was doing a lot of the selling. Nicholas could have matched that energy more

## Next Steps

1. **Lock onboarding date** with Timmy (target: this coming week)
2. **Get RSA list** for Palms/Lekki store
3. **Shorten lessons** based on Peter's feedback (2-3 pages, scannable)
4. **Request upsell matrix** from PRL commercial team
5. **Define trial success metrics** with Timmy before starting
6. **Prepare onboarding flow** — physical session, Telegram download, first quiz walkthrough
7. **Clarify ambiguous answer scoring** for Build the Basket

## Key Quote

> "Let's try it out. Let's see that everybody works is what we want. Then I'm sure we can look at the commercials." — Timmy

This is a **trial-approved** deal. The revenue conversation comes after proving value. Focus on making the trial undeniably successful.
