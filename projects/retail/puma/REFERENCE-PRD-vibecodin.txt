Raw PRD request to Claude:


Create me an extremely intensive 3,000 word PRD for a new AI app, which will be a competitor to Gamma slides.


Need a pretty landing page too with amazing copy, sections, lottie animations and styles, designs, grids and bentos, whitespace, animations.


The simple flow:


1. user uploads a document
2. AI ingests the document & creates a canvas of 8-10 slides with titles, subtitles, body text. no images for now as thats complex.
3. we will use supabase, next.js and vercel for this app
4. we will use edge functions with supabase to call the gemini flash 2.5 API to create the flow, likley in json, to create the individual slides
5. Gemini decides how many slides will be created, then print the raw json for each page
6. this then creates Canva style slides with Inter font, greyscale, beautiful and minimalist - leaving space on the left or right for images later
7. all of the json is saved to the backend in supabase, users can name and save entire projects, there is a simple canvas to edit the text after everything is saved. 
8. there is a simple dashboard with beautoful, minimalist inter-style fonts, greyscsale, thin, isometric icons - Dashboard with recent projects, Agent tab to create a new project where a user uploads or pastes the text, settings page, billing, all of this should like Attio or Linear - whitespace minimalist inter font, no buttons with heavy fill (all transparent buttons) no gradients or stupid colours - all just greyscale and minimal notion style.
9. the Gemini prompt with the edge function should not only decide from the text how kany slides, but also edit and improve the tetx itself inside the json to be more informative to create the amazing slides
10. the slides and editing module and page should be like canva, where there is a canvas of sorts showing all the tabs, zoom in zoom out, for now dont worry about fonts and editing etc as thats complex.
11. you should be able to 'present' the slides in a theatre type of mode to show it off like powerpoint or canva too.


We need to add supabase auth functionality and auth pages for login and sign up so users can create an account (don't gate this with stripe or anything right now its ok just allow login without verification)


below is the design PRD also to interweave into the total and final PRD




Got it—here's a pure UI/UX design style guide based on the Attio aesthetic you've shown: minimalist, spacious, and beautifully clean.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
1. Design philosophy
The Attio style is defined by restraint and clarity—every element earns its place on screen. The interface should feel like a calm, professional workspace where content takes center stage and chrome disappears. Key tenets:[strategybreakdowns]​


Reduction over addition: remove until it breaks, then add back one thing.
Typography as UI: hierarchy is established through type weight and size, not heavy borders or color blocks.
Quiet confidence: the design doesn't shout; it reassures through consistency and precision.
2. Color palette
RoleValueUsageBackground#FAFAFA or #F7F7F8Main canvas, never pure white [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​Surface#FFFFFFCards, modals, popovers [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​Border#E8E8ECSubtle dividers, input outlinesText primary#1A1A1AHeadings, body copyText secondary#6B6B76Labels, metadata, timestamps [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​Text muted#9CA3AFPlaceholders, disabled statesAccent#3B82F6 (soft blue)Links, primary buttons, focus rings [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​Success#22C55ECompleted states, positive indicatorsWarning#F59E0BPending states, attention badges [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​




Color is used sparingly—status pills and avatars provide the only pops of color against the neutral canvas.[figma]​
3. Typography
Use a geometric sans-serif typeface like Inter, which balances warmth with technical precision.[figma]​
ElementSizeWeightLine heightPage title20–22px600 (semibold)1.3Section header14–16px6001.4Body text13–14px400 (regular)1.5Caption/meta11–12px4001.4Button label13px500 (medium)1.0




Hierarchy rules:


Only two weights on any single screen (regular + semibold).
Size differences between levels should be at least 2px.
Letter-spacing: 0 for body, -0.01em for large headings.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
4. Spacing & layout
Generous whitespace is the signature of this style—it creates breathing room and visual calm.[agilesalesman]​
Base unit: 4px grid
Common increments: 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48px

Layout principles:


Left sidebar width: 220–260px, collapsible.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Main content max-width: 1200px, centered on large screens.
Right context panels: 320–400px.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Consistent 16–24px gutters between columns.
5. Component styling
Buttons
Primary: solid accent fill, 6px radius, no border, subtle hover darkening (5–10%).
Secondary: transparent background, 1px border in #E8E8EC, same radius.
Ghost: no background or border, accent text color, underline on hover.
Height: 36px standard, 32px compact.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Inputs & fields
Background: white or #FAFAFA.
Border: 1px solid #E8E8EC, radius 6px.
Focus state: 2px accent ring with 0.15 opacity glow.
Labels above inputs, never inside (except search).[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Cards & surfaces
Background: pure white.
Border: 1px solid #E8E8EC OR no border with subtle shadow.
Shadow (if used): 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.04), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06).
Radius: 8–12px.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Tags & status pills
Small rounded rectangles (radius 4–6px).
Soft tinted background matching status color at 10–15% opacity.
Text in darker shade of same hue.
Height: 20–24px, padding: 6px 10px.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Avatars
Circular, 24–32px for inline, 40–48px for headers.
Stacked avatars overlap by 30% with white 2px ring.
Fallback: initials on soft gradient background.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
6. Iconography
Style: 1.5px stroke, rounded caps and joins.
Size: 16px default, 20px for navigation, 14px for inline.
Color: inherit from text color (primary or secondary).
Alignment: optically centered within bounding box.
Recommended sets: Lucide, Phosphor, or Heroicons (outline variant).[nicelydone]​[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
7. Interaction & motion
Motion should be subtle and functional, never decorative.[reddit]​
InteractionDurationEasingHover state150msease-outFocus ring100msease-in-outModal open200msease-out (with slight scale from 98%)Sidebar collapse200msease-in-outToast slide-in250msease-out




Hover behaviors:


Table rows: background shifts to #F5F5F7, secondary actions fade in.[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws]​
Sidebar items: background tint appears, icon color shifts to accent.
Buttons: subtle darkening or lightening, no scale changes.
Focus states:


Always visible for accessibility.
2px accent ring with soft outer glow.
8. Do's and don'ts
Do:


Use whitespace liberally—when in doubt, add more padding.
Keep the color palette tight; let content provide variety.
Use type hierarchy instead of boxes and dividers.
Align everything to the grid obsessively.
Make interactive elements obvious through consistent patterns.
Don't:


Use drop shadows heavier than the card shadow above.
Add borders AND shadows to the same element.
Use more than one accent color.
NEVER use full fills of colour for any buttons
Rely on color alone to communicate state.
Animate anything longer than 300ms.
Use rounded corners larger than 12px (except full-round pills/avatars).
This style creates interfaces that feel expensive, calm, and trustworthy—ideal for tools where users spend hours daily managing complex data.[opensourceceo]​

## AI Integration Specification


### Gemini Flash 2.5 Prompt Engineering


**System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert presentation designer and content strategist. Your task is to analyze input text and generate a structured JSON output for a professional slide presentation.


RULES:
1. Create 8-10 slides (adjust based on content volume)
2. Improve and refine the original text for clarity and impact
3. Use concise, powerful language suitable for presentations
4. Structure content hierarchically: title → subtitle → body points
5. Each body point should be one clear sentence (max 15 words)
6. First slide should always be a title slide
7. Last slide should be a conclusion or call-to-action
8. Use section dividers for major topic transitions


OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure:
{
  "slideCount": number,
  "slides": [
    {
      "position": number,
      "layoutType": "title" | "content" | "section",
      "content": {
        "title": string,
        "subtitle": string | null,
        "body": string[] | null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


**User Prompt Template:**
```
Analyze the following document and create a professional presentation:


[DOCUMENT TEXT]


Create 8-10 slides that:
- Extract key insights and themes
- Improve clarity and conciseness
- Follow logical narrative flow
- Use professional presentation language
```


### Content Enhancement Guidelines


The AI should actively improve source content by:
- **Simplifying complex sentences** into digestible points
- **Extracting key statistics** and highlighting them
- **Creating logical groupings** of related concepts
- **Adding transition slides** for major topic shifts
- **Generating compelling titles** that capture slide essence
- **Removing redundancy** and filler language
- **Strengthening calls-to-action** and conclusions


**Example Transformation:**


*Original Text:*
"Our company has been experiencing significant growth in the market over the past fiscal year, with revenue increasing by approximately 45% year-over-year, which we attribute largely to our expanded product line and improved customer acquisition strategies."


*AI-Enhanced Slide:*
```json
{
  "title": "Exceptional Growth in FY2025",
  "subtitle": "45% Revenue Increase Year-Over-Year",
  "body": [
    "Expanded product portfolio drove new market penetration",
    "Optimized acquisition strategy reduced CAC by 30%",
    "Customer retention improved to 87% (up from 72%)"
  ]
}
```

## User Flows & Edge Cases


### Edge Case Handling


**Scenario: Upload fails**
- **Detection:** File size >10MB or unsupported format
- **Response:** Error toast, keep user on Agent page, highlight upload zone in red
- **Message:** "File too large. Please use documents under 10MB" or "Unsupported format. Please upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT"


**Scenario: Gemini API timeout**
- **Detection:** No response within 60 seconds
- **Response:** Show error message, offer retry
- **Message:** "Generation timed out. This usually means the document is very long. Try a shorter document or contact support."
- **Action:** Save uploaded document to allow manual retry


**Scenario: Gemini returns malformed JSON**
- **Detection:** JSON.parse() fails or schema validation fails
- **Response:** Log error, retry once automatically, then show error
- **Message:** "Something went wrong. Our AI had trouble processing this document. Please try again."


**Scenario: User edits during auto-save**
- **Detection:** User types while save in progress
- **Response:** Queue next save, don't interrupt typing
- **Indicator:** "Saving..." persists until queue clears


**Scenario: Network disconnect during presentation**
- **Detection:** Offline event
- **Response:** Show banner "You're offline. Presentation mode available, editing disabled."
- **Behavior:** Presentation continues from cached slides


**Scenario: Concurrent edits (future multiplayer)**
- **Not implemented in MVP**
- **Future:** Operational Transform or CRDT for conflict resolution
