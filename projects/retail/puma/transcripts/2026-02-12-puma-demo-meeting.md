Me: Hello. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.  
Them: Hi, Good afternoon. Can you start shorting?  
Me: Okay. I think if you guys are in the same room, we may have an issue with the feedback on. The microphone. I think that's why just now. It went round and round. So it might be easier to just have one.  
Them: Yes. I've created mine. And I'm using Simulane's mic now, so. Good. Now.  
Me: Ok? Ay, no problem.  
Them: Guys. We'll just give it, I guess, one. This session is about five more minutes. As it's finishing another meeting, so I guess. That maybe 12 fast. 2. We'll just start whether she say or not. Let's give it a few minutes. Okay. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So Malady is here. So we're all here now. Hi. Peter Nichol. And in the room here we've got, in hr, Adila Paul, who's in sales of Operations. And ate in the room as well. Who's in Operations? And then we have Peter on the call as well. So before we start, I'm going into introductions, and I know we can go into the demo. I just want to confirm if you can hear me clearly. FT.  
Me: Afternoon. Yep, I can hear you. Okay.  
Them: Okay? Grace. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, everyone. So to quickly go into it, I mean, there's a bit of a demonstration that FT will show, but to give a bit of a background. So one of the issues I know a few weeks, maybe a few months ago now, we sat down here and we're looking at how we can upscale and train the teams. And I know you guys are done some work on it. And we're looking through some of the work that has been done. But we also then looked internally to see how if we try to modernize the way we're training people, I may be using it, maybe align them, do it on their phones. Or working around the clock on it and learning continuously, it could be a more interesting and engaging training process for them. And when we look further, we looked at. Obviously, if we wanted to solve a problem, we'll start from where it's bigger. Which was one of our biggest stores, which is the Palm Store. Puma, the Lekki store. And that came about from the conversation, I believe was Peter that actually raised it to one of the commercial meetings. Seeing how he had noticed that when he spent time in the store. The store team was basically struggling to add on more products. Bring more options for the customers and obviously affecting ultimately the units per transactions, the units that were selling, cross selling, upselling, all those things that we know already as retailers. And so what then happened after that was I decided to meet with a partner of mine that worked on different projects with FTs on the call to see how we could build something that could hopefully help the team in an interactive way. Learn about these things and really. Get more up to date knowledge and more insightful, a better understanding of upskilling, upselling and then just being more efficient retailers. So really and truly, it's a whole training module that he has developed. And thank you Adila. At some point we also added to a meeting where he gave some of your insight and so taking what we have today, what he wants to present today is essentially. A demo, right, of the upskilling cross selling. Part of the whole retail training course is about. What we hope is that you guys will be able to see it. Today. Make sense of it. See if it makes sense. And ideally, we will do a trial. In the palm store. So, normally there's a fee for this trial, but I'm going to convince him that because I'm working here, We waive the trial fee, we can obviously talk about the final rollout when it comes to that. But let's try it out. Let's see that everybody works is what we want. Then I'm sure we can look at the commercials. But obviously he has agreed for now on that basis. Normally, this is meant to be paid. So the idea would be, once we go through this demo, now we. Everyone looks at it, if it makes sense. We can look into maybe sometime next week. Doing a tryout. Tryout? We're about six or seven weeks. So that we can see if there's any improvements in the store. We follow up with them every week. And see if the guys are actually responding well to it before we then look at ruling it out. Company wide. So I guess on the basis of that, I'll hand over to Eft, and then you can run us through what you want to share.  
Me: Thanks, timmy. Let me just try and share. Okay? Can we see my screen?  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Okay? Amazing. Okay, cool. So thank you, Tim, for the introduction. I think we've covered most of. The initial points. So the way that. We have tried to approach this is that we know some of the issues that come with a standard lesson. Right. Some of the things that happen with having static information. Is that people will read the information. They may understand it, but it's not going to teach them. They're not going to learn, and they're not going to be able to practice on static information. Although this has a standard course setup, it also has some add ons and I thought it would be better for us to go through what those add ons are and you can look at the course content later. So here what we have is modules, which is lessons. We have quizzes and we have games. What I'm going to do first is show you one of the more interesting games so that everyone can get a feel for the approach that we're taking in this mobile first way of training salespeople. To help them understand how to do cross selling and upselling better. So the game that we have here is what customer says, I've already got it here. So what this game is for doing is for helping staff to identify what type of customer that they're talking to. Initially before they start to say, okay, what should I try and say to this person? So I'll go through a bit of this game. So, for example, Customer says that they go to the gym waiting cardio for this one. We know that this is going to be an activity buyer. So you can see that it's giving us feedback. It's saying here as well, we have a streak, so on and so forth. This is still an activity buyer. So now I'll do one that is wrong, and you can see it's giving the person feedback. Now, as we are going through this, I think one of the points that I want to explain is that by using a game mechanic, as opposed to just having people read, they're actually able to practice this, and this is how we will be able to track how people are performing. This is the game, but we also have the quiz, so let me just quickly go through a bit more. Because we have 10 games here.  
Them: Did you guys have the chance to go through the link? Question. Okay, we'll get to.  
Me: Okay, cool. So this is obviously the beginning one, but you have your result, your accuracy, and the things that you need to practice on. So you can imagine now, at this point, right now, today, what someone would do is they would share this. They can just do a screenshot and post it into what is also part of this offering. And we will get to later, which is the telegram group, because if we have a course, however, we package that course, but we do not have a community. It's very hard for us to track the improvement, to see who is engaged and who is less engaged, and also for us to take in feedback so that when we do go through, to actually put this through to full production, it's a bit more customized and even what was first shown to you guys today. Give me one second. Okay? So now if we come back to the course outline, just so you guys can have a bit more of a higher level viewers that we have three modules. So you have module one being the foundation, module two being cross setting. And this is where you have the games. And then module three, which is probably going to be something more specific that within the Puma playbook, but it probably won't be as part of the trial, it would be for afterwards. So you can see we play the customer says game. So what I'll do now is I'll show you the lesson for that game. So this is something that's again, someone can look at on their phone and they can understand why are we doing this? Because what happens is the customer walks in, they treat everyone the same with the same approach. And essentially, money is leaving the store. It's a missed opportunity to cross someone Upsell. And we've tried to take in different piece of information. And present it in a way that is digestible. And then off of this, they either have a quiz or a game. When we actually get to a point where we'll be pushing this forward. We can also start to add PUMA product imagery, as you can see here, so that people can get a better context for what it is that. They're learning about as opposed to just everything being theoretical. Your note here as well, that we've actually taken the product SKU or the product list that was provided, and we use that. We've ingested that into the content. So it's not about random items, it's specifically for what items. Are being installed in your store. Before we contact, are there any questions so far?  
Them: So, any questions so far? I mean, I guess just be clear so far for the team. So I don't know if everyone knows Telegram, but I'm sure a lot of people know Telegram, the Army. So this is based on Telegram. So for people to be able to access this, just need to have downloaded Telegram like you have. Just like a WhatsApp. The link I sent you? Yeah, the down was just. We took a part of it out for you to be able to see, but essentially, when we're talking about community, It's almost like we have WhatsApp group for palm store. So each rsa will. Have their phone and have telegram on their phone. So there will be a palm store, for example, Lekki Puma palms. Telegram group. So you heard when we're saying that they'll take a screenshot. Of what they do. So when you do your quiz or whatever it is you need to do that day, you take it. This page is showing up now. You can take your screenshot and put it on the group. That's where you know if this person has done it, Ielts has not done. There's also a dashboard. Maybe somebody understands customer. Like the person understands what kind of customers they are telling you. Or maybe they're unable to sell to the customer know that they don't know what the customer wants, but they don't know the product. So it's going to give us something inside. So maybe somebody hike the best thing product, but customer approach is now what we need to work on. Forgive us. Like if I look. Okay. You mean course. Yeah. We can see what for each module what the person has called. So if you look at the dashboard and see that this person scored very low on like cross selling module, then we know that there's also a gap there, that maybe he didn't really understand what was taught. And even for us then we now had to physically work with that person. But yeah, able to see where someone is extending or not. Right. Ft, do you want to add any.  
Me: It? Kind of. Kind of. So you are right that the whole point here is for us to track. But one of the reasons why this is better than a lot of the other ways that you would approach teaching someone. It's all well and good for us to know that someone did what they scored on a lesson. And this is why we also have the quizzes and the games. Because although we can know what someone has scored on a lesson, By having the quizzes and the games that they are practicing. It's not about what they statically got, but we'll also be able to see how they've improved. I specifically also want to take this time to just say you'll be able to see all of these. But there are three games right now. There is the customer says one, there is build the basket, and there is the approach. The follow one from customer says is the approach. So this is after you've identified what the customer or who the customer is now is the approach. What do you say for different people? Can you still see my screen? Hello.  
Them: Yeah. Here we can. Yeah.  
Me: I'll just quickly show you the approach so you can see all of the games. So now this is someone who's saying, we've identified that they're a gift buyer, and they said, it's for my son. And now you can see that this is to do specifically with items. So we have this. He said it's wrong. This is how do I clean. So we know this is a material conscious person. What approach should we take? Okay, we're having this again. This is based off of the specific items in your sku and we've tried to just as a quick aside, because one thing that happens, especially at university, is that when you have these multi choice questions. People kind of group together and then do the test themselves. So although you can see eight questions here, we have, like, a bank of, like, 80 questions. So it's going to do a different assortment of them each time so that people aren't necessarily learning and they're not just gaming the system. Anyway, I'll go through this, just so you see. So this is another game. I'm not really going to pay attention to what it is. I just want you to see from end to end. And again, they can take the screenshot. And lastly. Is the build the basket. I think build basket might be the one. That you're seeing a bit more or wanting people to play a bit more. And I've tried to gamify the idea of adding something to a basket so you already know the person. You already know what they came for. You can already see what they're buying. So this is the third game. We can add images here, but the point is, this person is buying this item. What does the salesperson think we can add for the cross selling and upsenter specifically to treat them this skill? So let's say they think.  
Them: So just. Coming here. Hit is high intensity interval, fine intensity interval training. So it's like a way of working out in the gym. You jump, you stop, you do press ups. It's like high intensity, but you do it shorter time. So what this is trying to. If someone comes in to say, this is the kind of training I do. In the gym. And I'm buying, obviously. For example, you won't buy nitros for that, right? Nitrous are running shoes. Need something with a bit more stability and all of that. So you can give an then instead of just giving them what they wanted to buy. From these options. What else do you think I can upsell to them? Again, like maybe just a basic T shirt because of the intensity training Rava. Do you understand? So that's just making them is essentially trying to force people to start thinking beyond what someone payment for. What else can you push to the person to make sure that they are also able to live with a bigger basket? And that's what this whole game is about. So I think ft, I just wanted to. But there's a question in the room. I think it's when notifications can see that. But I would also like to click on include upsetting. So you are suggesting same product that does anything but more expensive. So this is showing us prospering. There's nothing about showing your stay. You can have the same product for maybe add that to it. It would be great as well. So they know that it's not just running product. They can speak human rights you can use for the training. Cannot reach something else that is greater or in newer facility. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah.  
Me: In the same way. I guess this is a good time to again reiterate this point on why I believe that this is bringing a different type of value. Right? What you're talking about is a whole other game. But we are able to do it and we are able to ingest it. But I think right now we wouldn't be able to add it. And the reason why is because we'd have to first take another bit of information from you guys. Which is what is your business context or what is your business logic for upselling? Right. So a matrix of this product is low, this is medium, this is high. And then what the options are for each of those for as many things as you want. The amount of time to take that and then add it and then build it would be a separate scope. But it's not something that we couldn't do. It's just that right now I don't have the business logic from you guys. On what is a correct upsell and what is a wrong upsell. But we can still train. And you can see how it would work here. You would say, this is this product that this person has. This is the higher tier. If there is a lower tier here is a lower tier, how would you suggest it to them? But we would also need to understand specifically for your store, specifically for your product, specifically for your type of customer, so that we're training people on the right context and not just generalized information. Does that make sense? Okay?  
Them: Okay? So should we move forward?  
Me: Yeah, sure. I just wanted to show the feedback of what it looks like. So you have correct, you have wrong, you have missed. So people can start to understand. Okay, I've done this. I've done. I'll run through the rest of it so that you can see the final page. So you can understand again how this works. And you can see the feedback as well is not just right or wrong, but it says, like, good match for this person. And then again, it tells you what your score is, what this is and everything here. So let's go back. We've already looked at the lessons, we have already looked at the games. You can already see the rough outline. I think the last thing now to show which object. I'm not physically there, but Timmy has his phone and has telegram. So you can now see the kind of community part that stitches everything together.  
Them: Yeah. So I think let's just come round my phone quickly. This is obviously Telegram. WhatsApp, basically is that WhatsApp? So FCI developed something that is like just regime. It's a PR of mine. It's like plums lekke. So all of us are in group, just like any WhatsApp group, right? But then there are prisons that they can do in the group. So, for example. You can see that I would ask them question. I just walked in front of the podcast now since timing them 50, 36, 05 seconds. Entry in 10 seconds are closing seconds. What does this mean? Is it? Five minutes. 30 minutes to 5 hours contact. 30 steps. Or is it time to see, Time to talk. Or approach. Then you pick it and you save your writing on. Then you give it an extra. Also is making them do questions to bring in the next question. 2 out of 5. And then it keeps going until you complete the task. Basically say you're wrong or right. So basically, this is another way we will now be able to track. As a group on the telegram group, how the engagement is, who is doing what. Because obviously telling the things we are not done. It's like WhatsApp. If we write it and trying to write. If I'm doing this, you'll be able to see this person has studied or this person has not failed. It or the person. Got it. I'm just one link. Gets around, extends. Yes, ft on this.  
Me: Yeah, I just wanted to add on the quiz. So at the end, so there's a couple things, you can always quit the quiz. And the reason that we're doing this. Is. So we are following the same model that, say, an Uber has to follow. Uber has many drivers that aren't behind the desk. In terms of the salespeople, they aren't behind the desk. So we're making things that allow them to practice when they have the time, and that in turn is allowing us to get a higher engagement and to meet them on a platform that they're already using. That's why we have the exit button. We also have it that when you are getting things wrong. You'll see that there's a little. Light bulb icon. When you click that, it will give you a bit more specifications. There's also a response within the bot, within the quiz. Bot that is giving you a longer explanation for what you got wrong. And you can also link. I think to me it might already be there. It will give you the lesson that that is specifically for. So this is why I'm saying it's everything. So we've seen the games, we've now seen the quizzes, and we've now seen the lessons, and we can see how it's an interactive thing that isn't requiring anyone to at one time all be together.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So you can see how it's scalable as well. I guess. Maybe. Sorry.  
Them: So I think. No, I was just trying to bring you together for everyone in the room. So the reality is, obviously, we want to see how we want to do a test. Obviously, we learn a lot as well as we do to try out with PRL and you guys, to learn a lot about the platform. Especially in the first few days, weeks, when the team is fiddling with seeing the dashboard, you're seeing how to track it. And that's why, obviously, FTIs with that fee, because really, get the understanding on both sides. For us, it's really more about, let's make something that can work, can get a position where everybody in the stores is using this kind of training on the go. And every month you can tell them, make sure you complete this module, this module. And then they're doing it. And as you have new products are even able to populate. The platform with new products as well. So that the questions also, the information is also updating is something that is a lot more in line with where we want to be than just doing the training. Once you understand, and then they move on from it. So it's almost like coaxial find a way to make it a part of being an RSA here? So I think obviously, I'm sure closer to the onboarding, I didn't see if we can try and start trialing next week. But Jokosa to the onboarding ft research on the short term network downloading telegram doing some creating their own telegram account. We'll see how we can show the dashboard as well and then we can start seeing performance. I think it's very important that we see if this thing can work. If also the business will see value in the interest. I believe there's a lot of value in it from what we are doing today. I think FT is showing on the screen. Just an idea of what the kind of weekly training dashboard can look. Like the name you can see who didn't know, you can see completion, who did well in words. So it's very straightforward. Yes. By the time you look at this kind of dashboard, Let me see. We.  
Me: So I want to. I want to something that, like everything that we're seeing here. Is a direct is downstream of proper engagement in the group. So things like floor winds. If we're not able to get people to say, I did this and I got like every day they are noting a win within the telegram group. This is why it's so important, because you can see from a manager standpoint, the type of thing you'd be able to have if people are. Doing quizzes, doing games and reporting the wins, because then you can see who's at risk. You can see the number of telegram, message floor wins, quiz score. And this is this view that you're seeing now is probably going to change and become more of a thing during the trial. It's not going to be a whole software that is built out. It will be a page that will probably update. Maybe weekly, and then at the end of every day or something like that, but again. The more that people are engaging in the telegram group, the more it can be understood what is needed, what's nice to have and what is a bit far out. So that then, when we have the proper discussion, You're actually getting a bespoke training. Because that's the thing that people aren't able to give. It's very difficult to give a bespoke training and to update it quickly. But it definitely requires I just want to keep honing on that point. It definitely requires everyone that's involved in it to say, this didn't work, or this is working, or I won with this, or this customer said this and this wasn't part of the scenarios, for example. And then we add a new scenario for the next batch of people. Does that make sense?  
Them: 've come to the end of the initial demo. The dashboard now and then there's a telegram. But I'm sure, I'm guessing that when we want to really kick off in the stores, maybe next week, we'll probably have to get everyone physically together, maybe just for the store open, make sure that they vote Downloaded telegram on board. We also need to be a bit more confident on how we're looking at disaster boards and tracking all of that. But I think those things can be done in the next one week or save want to onboard so that then we can now really start looking at what the progress will be looking at over maybe six weeks from then. That's how I foresee it. I don't know if. I think just for the future, it would just be good to see if I can do any kind of customization so that it can be PR focused. And I also just my own experience on Facebook yesterday, I didn't see that page that this game. Activity just to put to one exam, so I don't know whether it depends. On. The link, but I just wanted to give that feedback. What's the matrix? Thank you.  
Me: So. I was struggling to hear that. But about the dashboard. The dashboard is something that will come with the full version, but we are using the data to generate. Not real time, but you'll get reports, like probably end of the day and then end of the week.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: In terms of the flow, right? Because you saw one screen. That's what the telegram bot is doing. So you join your telegram bot. So, you know, when Timmy was showing, he pressed start, and then it gave you what you wanted. So you're not actually having to do too much thinking. It's actually guiding you. Down, you press start. Okay, where are you in the week? You can't even, for example, move past a certain quiz number. If you don't score a certain number so you don't score 80%, you can't move to Quiz 2, for example.  
Them: We do the quizzes that you don't pass.  
Me: Pardon?  
Them: Does it give you the chance to reattend?  
Me: Me at the end of when you used it. Did it. Did you see where it said, retry the quiz? Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, Retry is already there. The exit is already there. Linking what you got wrong to the lessons that teach you what you got wrong is already there.  
Them: Yes. This is.  
Me: The flow to go. From start to then try and understand where you want to go in terms of your module. It's already going to tell you because it's going to know where you are. So most of the things have already been accounted for. So that you're moving the student through a process or a funnel, as opposed to kind of like you can itself paste, and you can go everywhere, anywhere that you want to go.  
Them: Okay? That makes sense. Thank you.  
Me: No problem.  
Them: I think that would work. Yeah. If you have any other questions, thoughts. Just make a NAS because you don't have to go back then. I also feel like you have a lot of votings. I don't know if you can try to because I know some people will not read. At my point I was also just speaking. I'll just sit at the closure and just click and so if maybe like new journals to indicate a front. If this is a socks an extra shoe. So that one is like something we need to deliberate on. If that would be Demi Kwan. Now you said be sure of the products they are selecting. Just let the randomly. Because you have to explain to me at some point I was just clicking the product because he was bringing. But then when I now calmed down, I come down. I took my time and now read. And also he was giving us different customers responses for teams. But I know that. Figure. I don't think they will know anything that is speaking about the approach or I want this because the last one he received experts via. So it was really insightful. Maybe if you can have one of courses just be like straight to the point, something that they can just cross through and click so that they are really between what they do that you just need to. Because I did one with all this and I just tell them. Then I also not just looking to do great and I feel like so for one that I can click multiple what do I score overall at the end of the game? How is written because I did want to spot it as something I was just dreaming. Then the other one I really checked. But overall, it is really great. And the part that I love the most was this approach. The basket was a lot of complication. Customers. I like that one because he was telling us. So I went, give me something. For example, the one that had for my son's birthday. My buying as a gift for my son and my son can work. They can make other things aside from the product. So that's really things that would complement what he's just buying alone. Then they also said something like, do you want me to get a premium package for it? So should I go for the premium package? They're trying to suggest other things, or should I order options? I feel like the answer also said, I think there's an option that says. I was just saying. No. Right. So try get the mark for selecting.  
Me: Sorry. I move a map of.  
Them: You know, there's no right. I mean, it's just there. So do I get a master? So how do you get graded? How does you get graded on that kind of answer? Where it's like, it could be right, it could be wrong, but you're not wrong, so you didn't miss it.  
Me: Yeah. So if we look at what I'm bringing is the technical expertise, but you guys know the business logic. So it's all dependent on what in your world counts as right and what is wrong. And maybe there's a priority one right answer. And there's a priority too right answer based on what the business strategically wants. So, for example, let's say someone is buying sports shoes. And you guys, I've all agreed that you would like them to upsell that person with socks. Cool, but the business is trying to develop a relationship with someone else and so they would rather that they recommend disc socks or this socks that comes from ingesting that business logic given by you guys. Does that make sense?  
Them: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, but I think we'll look into the answer. Yeah. A particular question. If you answer it, if you're done with it, if you try to go back, get other questions. So we have crowned the answer. That's a try for shuffling the question.  
Me: So, timmy, can you.  
Them: They like? I think it's. It's pulling from a pool. Of questions, so it's shuffling the questions, and they're not the same every time.  
Me: Because we was all cheating.  
Them: Okay? I think what about this is something.  
Me: Sorry. Go.  
Them: So. Okay, so we went into the quiz, right? And I was also thinking that would it be fine? Because get we have a lesson before the quiz. Before. It's just. We just. It just took a dark quiz part out for you guys to see how the interaction. Is, but in the normal actual flow. This is lesson first.  
Me: Let me. Let me clarify. We're building on top of what everyone is used to. Everyone is used to reading and scrolling. So that's how you have your lessons. I think my screen is still being shared.  
Them: Then the quiz.  
Me: So that's what. These are, the lessons. So you go through this lesson. It will tell you these things that, oh, this is the method. That's why you got that question. Here's the things that you say what you don't say. So you go through all of this, and then the point is that you would then add the thing for you to do. The question. But the point here is that this is a page that opens from the telegram. The quiz is a page that opens from the telegram. The game is something that opens from the telegram so that everything is packaged in some way. They don't even need to go on a website. They open Telegram and they can access these things. If they get stock, they can type reset, they can type start. And so we can have people actually able to utilize a 10 minute slot very well, as opposed to all I need to find somewhere quiet or I need to put headphones in and listen to someone talk for a video. We've missed all of that and we're going straight to practice that is based in the product knowledge that you guys have. And then a later date, should you guys want to go forward. We can even take on more business logic and think of other things. But it has to be scoped out because of course, as we can see, it's very easy to overwhelm people. We've had to make these bite sized so that it covers enough in the Times, even the five to seven minutes. It's not going to take five to seven minutes. It's more that we want the person to have an understanding, know that they can come back to the lesson if they need. And then they can practice and that that practice is being recorded, and then they will themselves try to implement. So you'll see. For example, today's action. Acknowledge Every customer within five seconds. Approach within 60. Now, we may find that that doesn't work, but this is where the feedback comes into the group to try and improve these things specifically. For the location. And that's again, how you get a bespoke offer that's built in data. Does that answer the question?  
Them: I think we'll take the feedback of streamlining. I can do that. But you were saying that even this page is too the student long story. So to also see the fourth answer. I don't want those papers. But when we break, we can do shorter lessons.  
Me: I mean, what I would say is that whether they do the lesson or not, They still have to do the quiz and they still have to do the game. So spending the time to, for example, shorten this when it's only a reference thing anyway, that they look at once. As opposed to them playing, they could scan this, and then they could play the game three times. And if they play the game three times over the day, That's better than us making it easier for them to read something because at the end of the day, we're trying to change behavior. This is us trying to teach a change in behavior so that the average order value goes up in the store. So as much as reading the lesson could help, it's really about practice and then them sharing their wins or things that aren't going well for them. To try and improve the behavior and show them that giving feedback actually turns out to things that will benefit them.  
Them: Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I guess fc we can talk about offline, because if I didn't fulfill that. The continuity needs to be streamlined and we just need to look into it, but I guess.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Okay. Anything else? At. You. Quite interesting. I mean, it looks familiar. Do it. Was much more, but this was. I mean, I like the customer. This is actually streamlining. And it was very interesting and I liked. I believe there's something that we just need to get the interest. Might not really want to. We might want to something else instead of going into. So I think it's something that you need to control my b on our sending back. Give them a specific time or something like training days where we say, okay, this, let's say Wednesday this morning, all of you go on. Stock phones. Do the quiz. Do your thing so that they're focusing on it. Maybe someone can catch. That. Peter, you're on the call as well. I don't know if you're going, but I was going back. I forgot I was big. I was looking for business. Boats. Big in my. Before we go, I don't know if there's anything you wanted to add or give good. Afternoon, everyone.  
Me: Good afternoon.  
Them: Yesterday night I was able to go to the. Honestly speaking, educating. Slight. Just like Adela. If some of the models can be compressed. You shouldn't have more volumes. Compressing a little bit. Into it. Then rscs. I believe it also give us an edge to track their performance. Even It's a good idea. Honestly, it's a good idea. Actually. We can get more lines that they can easily go through because most of them before we knew they'll start complaining that the module is too much. After the day. There are three tires to go through those ones. But if they can give them something that is a bit simple that you can easily grow in class two, maybe within five minutes. Two or three pages. I think it's fine. But it's a good idea. Honestly, it's a good idea. Thank you. Thank you very much, Peter. All right. Thank you, everyone. We're basically at time. We have another meeting, I think in the same room before, and I know he's on his way. But, yeah. Thanks, everyone. Thank you very much, ft, for your time for the demo. I guess after this we'll now talk about. Obviously we take on both some of the feedback you guys have shared. Then we'll talk about. Read it the onboarding side. So you want to try to the Puma store? How do we get the managers, I mean the managers and RNCs on Telegram, stress and everything out, and then we start. It's giving us this about six weeks. So we need to just try and make it work so we can really learn. And if it's something that is good, then we can roll it out to the other stores. All right, thanks, everyone. So FT will connect later.  
Me: Okay? No problem.  
Them: Thank you.
