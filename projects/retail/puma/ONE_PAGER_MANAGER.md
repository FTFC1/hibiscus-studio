# PUMA Training Pilot - Manager Guide
**What You Need to Do (6 Weeks)**

---

## Your Role: Monitor & Support (Not Teach)

The training runs automatically on Selar (mobile platform). Staff learn independently. **Your job:** Track progress and verify practical application.

---

## Week 1 (Feb 10-16): Setup

**Day 1 (Feb 10):**
1. Receive dashboard login from FORJE (30-min training call)
2. Help 7 staff create Selar accounts (5 mins each)
3. Join Telegram channel (daily tips will be posted)

**Throughout week:**
- Check dashboard Mon/Wed/Fri (see who completed missions)
- Nudge stragglers: "Have you done Mission 1 yet?"

---

## Weeks 2-6 (Feb 17-March 22): Monitor

**Every Monday/Wednesday/Friday:**
1. **Check dashboard** (2 mins): Who completed? Who passed quiz?
2. **Observe practical tasks** (10-15 mins): Watch staff apply techniques
3. **Post wins in Telegram** (1 min): "Chidi got 100% on Mission 3 quiz!"

**Weekly review (Fridays, 10 mins):**
- Who's falling behind? (follow up 1-on-1)
- What patterns do you see? (staff struggling with same concept?)
- Any issues? (report to FORJE via WhatsApp)

---

## What's in the Dashboard

**You'll see:**
- Mission completion status (✅ complete, ⏳ in progress, ⚪ not started)
- Quiz scores (100%, 80%, failed)
- Time spent per mission
- Practical task submissions (photos/videos staff upload)

**Export to CSV** for your own tracking if needed.

---

## Practical Task Verification (Your Key Responsibility)

**Each mission has a practical task** (e.g., "Use Opening #3 with 2 customers today").

**How to verify:**

**Option 1: Direct observation** (best for Missions 1-3)
- Watch staff interact with customer (5 mins)
- Fill out simple checklist on phone (Did they make eye contact in 5 seconds? ✅)
- Upload photo of checklist to dashboard

**Option 2: Self-report + spot check** (Missions 4-6)
- Staff describes what they did (100 words in Telegram)
- Peer witness confirms ("I saw Tunde do this")
- You spot-check 1-2 randomly per week

**Option 3: Video role-play** (objection handling missions)
- Staff records 60-second role-play with co-worker
- Uploads to dashboard
- You approve/reject

**Time commitment:** 30-45 mins/week total for 7 staff

---

## Telegram Channel (Daily Engagement)

**What you'll post:**
- Mon/Wed/Fri: "Mission X unlocks today! Link in pinned message 👇"
- Mid-week: "3 people passed Mission 2 quiz—who's next?"
- Friday: "Shout-out to Amara for using 70/30 Rule with 5 customers this week!"

**What staff will post:**
- Daily wins ("Used Opening #2 today, customer loved it!")
- Questions ("What if customer says 'just browsing'?" → You answer or tag FORJE)
- Peer challenges ("Who can get 5 cross-sells this week?")

**Time commitment:** 5-10 mins/day

---

## What Staff Experience

**Mon/Wed/Fri:**
1. Telegram notification: "Mission 3 unlocked! 👇"
2. Click link → Opens Selar on phone
3. Read lesson (8-10 mins)
4. Take quiz (5 questions, 80% to pass)
5. Pass → Next mission unlocks in 48 hours
6. Practice technique at work next day

**Total time per staff:** 10-15 mins, 3× per week = 30-45 mins/week

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚨 **Staff not completing missions on time**
→ 1-on-1: "What's blocking you? Need help accessing Selar?"

🚨 **Low quiz scores (below 60%)**
→ Content too hard. Report to FORJE for adjustment.

🚨 **No practical task submissions**
→ Staff avoiding floor application. Requires coaching.

🚨 **Telegram crickets (no engagement)**
→ Post more actively, ask direct questions, celebrate small wins

---

## Success Metrics (What FORJE Tracks)

**Week 2:** 80%+ staff completing missions on time
**Week 4:** 15-20% basket size increase (₦25K → ₦29-30K avg)
**Week 6:** 1.8 items per transaction (up from 1.3)

**You'll see this in your weekly sales reports.** FORJE will analyze trends and send you insights.

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

**Platform issues** (staff can't log in, quiz not working):
→ WhatsApp FORJE support

**Content questions** (staff confused about concept):
→ Post in Telegram, FORJE monitors daily

**Weekly check-ins:**
→ FORJE calls you Fridays (15 mins) to review progress

---

## After Pilot (Week 7)

**March 23-29:**
- Final report delivered (completion %, sales lift, quiz data)
- Case study interview (30 mins with FORJE)
- Decision: Scale to 20 staff? 50 staff? Other brands?

---

## Your Time Commitment Summary

**Week 1:** 2 hours (setup + training call)
**Weeks 2-6:** 1 hour/week (dashboard checks + observations + Telegram)
**Total:** ~8 hours over 6 weeks

**ROI:** If training works, your staff will be making ₦1.68M more per month with minimal ongoing effort from you.
