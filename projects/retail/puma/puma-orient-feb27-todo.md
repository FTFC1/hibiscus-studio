# PUMA Orient — Do Tomorrow (Feb 27)

## Status: FROZEN since Feb 23. Design decided, nothing built.

## 3 Questions to Confirm (voice note, 30 sec)
1. **Telegram message format?** → Proposed: "Hey [name], how's Mission [N] going? Need any help?" — casual, manager edits before sending, goes to store group chat
2. **Nudge history visible to staff?** → Proposed: No. Manager-only. Telegram message IS the staff nudge. In-app log = manager dashboard only.
3. **Practice certified dead-end?** → Proposed: Celebration screen + 2 CTAs ("Check today's missions" + "Play Approach Game"). No PDF. Kill the dead end with forward paths.

## Build Plan (~1 session if questions pre-answered)
- [ ] Confirm/correct the 3 answers
- [ ] Build Manager Action Panel mockup (/design-round)
- [ ] Code: StaffDetail.jsx nudge button + Telegram deep link (~50 lines)
- [ ] Code: Practice completion forward paths (~20 lines)
- [ ] Deploy to puma-training.vercel.app

## Cross-Pollination (from Mikano/Flour Girls/Aloe, Feb 24-26)
- **Flour Girls review tool** snap-scroll format → use for mockup presentation
- **Mikano stock tool** drill-down pattern (tap item → detail → action) = same as manager tap staff → detail → nudge
- **Mikano meeting card** 5-step sequential = format for #44 commercial pitch later
- **Aloe ICP** — PUMA is proof case if retail training survives as sub-vertical
- **"Reasoning is prepaid"** — shape #44 commercial model pricing before building

## Board
- #43 [PUMA] UI polish — voice review items ← ACTIVE
- #44 [PUMA] Commercial model ← READY (shape first)
- #46 [BUILD] Command Center v2 ← SHAPING
