# What Goes in Telegram vs. What Goes in Selar
**Platform Roles: Learning vs. Engagement**

---

## Quick Answer

**Selar = Structured learning** (missions, quizzes, certificates)
**Telegram = Daily engagement** (tips, wins, community)

**Think:** Selar is the classroom, Telegram is the break room.

- Thu: "Shout-out to Amara for using 70/30 Rule with 8 customers this week 🔥"
- Fri: "Weekend challenge: Practice Opening #2 with 5 customers. Post your best win Sunday!"

**Staff-generated content:**
- "Used Mission 3 technique today, customer bought 3 items instead of 1!"
- "Question: What do I say when customer says 'I'll think about it'?" (peer/manager answers)
- "I got 100% on Mission 5 quiz!" (peer celebration)

**Manager posts:**
- Mission unlock reminders ("Mission 7 drops in 1 hour!")

- "Share your best Opening #1 story"

### What's NOT in Telegram:
- Full mission content (too long, that's Selar)
- Quizzes (auto-graded in Selar, not manual)
- Structured lessons (Telegram is micro-tips, not curriculum)
- Certificates (generated in Selar)

## Why Both Platforms?

**"Why not just Telegram?"**
- No quiz validation (honor system doesn't prove learning)
- No drip content (staff could race through 24 missions in one day)
- No completion tracking (can't see who's done what)
- No certificates (no formal credential)
- Too much scrolling (finding Mission 8 in chat history = nightmare)

**"Why not just Selar?"**
- No daily engagement (staff log in Mon/Wed/Fri only, forget between)
- No peer community (isolated learning, no wins shared)
- No real-time Q&A (Selar is async, questions sit unanswered)
- No manager nudges (no way to say "Mission unlocks in 1 hour!")

**Together:** Selar provides structure, Telegram provides motivation.

## Content Distribution Split

### Selar Gets:
- **Long-form lessons** (800-1,200 words)
- **Structured frameworks** (4 Questions Framework, 5 Warm Openings)
- **Detailed examples** (luxury retail case study, Nike manager quote)
- **Quizzes** (5 questions per mission, auto-graded)
- **Quick Reference cards** (print-friendly takeaways)

### Telegram Gets:
- **Micro-tips** (1-3 sentences, quick reminders)
- **Mission unlock alerts** ("Mission 7 is live!")
- **Wins** ("Chidi just closed a ₦180K sale using Mission 5 technique!")
- **Peer Q&A** ("How do you handle price objections?" → community answers)
- **Challenges** ("Who can get 5 cross-sells this week?")

### Rule of Thumb:
- **If it needs >5 mins to read:** Selar
- **If it's a quick reminder/tip:** Telegram
- **If it needs to be graded:** Selar
- **If it's peer-to-peer:** Telegram

## Sample Week: Content Distribution

**Monday:**
- **Selar:** Mission 7 unlocks ("Automatic Add-Ons: The ₦15K Upgrade")
- **Telegram (9am):** "Mission 7 is live! Learn the automatic add-on technique 👇 [Selar link]"
- **Telegram (2pm):** "Quick tip: When customer buys running shoes, ask 'Do you have running socks?' 60% say yes!"

**Tuesday:**
- **Telegram (10am):** "Shout-out to Tunde for using automatic add-on 6 times yesterday. Keep going!"
- **Telegram (3pm):** "Reminder: Mission 7 quiz due by tomorrow. Need 80% to unlock Mission 8."

**Wednesday:**
- **Selar:** Mission 8 unlocks ("The Outfit Complete Framework")
- **Telegram (9am):** "Mission 8 drops now! Learn how to build complete outfits 👇"
- **Telegram (4pm):** "Pro tip: If customer buys track pants, suggest matching hoodie. Say 'Most people grab the set.'"

**Thursday:**
- **Telegram (11am):** "Question from Amara: 'Customer said outfit is too expensive. What do I say?' → Check Mission 5 for price objection scripts!"
- **Telegram (5pm):** "End-of-day check: Who practiced Outfit Complete today? Comment below!"

**Friday:**
- **Selar:** Mission 9 unlocks ("Bundle Building: The ₦50K Basket")
- **Telegram (9am):** "Last mission of the week! Bundle building = your secret weapon for ₦50K baskets 👇"
- **Telegram (6pm):** "Week 3 recap: 5 staff completed all missions on time. 2 still need Mission 8. Catch up this weekend!"

## Technical Details

**How does Telegram link to Selar?**
- Manager posts Selar course link in Telegram pinned message
- Staff tap link → Opens browser → Logs into Selar → Sees mission
- One-time login (Selar remembers device)

**Can staff comment on missions in Selar?**
- No (Selar is one-way delivery)
- Questions/discussions happen in Telegram

**How do managers post to Telegram?**
- Manual posts (manager types message daily)
- OR: Pre-scheduled posts (Telegram has built-in scheduler)
- OR: Automation (Zapier/IFTTT can auto-post at set times, but requires setup)

**Recommendation for pilot:** Manual posts (builds authentic manager engagement). Automate later if scaling to 50+ staff.

## Bottom Line

**Selar = What they learn** (missions, quizzes, structure)
**Telegram = How they stay engaged** (tips, wins, community)

**Without Selar:** No proof of learning, no quiz validation, no drip control
**Without Telegram:** Staff forget between missions, no peer support, low motivation

**Together:** 80%+ completion rate, peer learning culture, daily habit formation.
