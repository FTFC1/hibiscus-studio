# Cohort Progression: Beta → 20 Staff → 50 Staff
**How Staff Move Through the Program (Selar + Telegram)**

---

## PHASE 1: Beta Cohort (7 Staff)
**Feb 3 - March 15, 2026**

### Selar (Learning Platform):
- 7 staff enrolled
- Missions unlock Mon/Wed/Fri
- Each staff progresses at own pace (quiz-gated)
- Admin dashboard tracks: completion %, quiz scores, time spent

### Telegram (Engagement):
- 1 channel created: "PUMA Sales Mastery"
- 7 staff + 1 manager join
- Daily tips posted
- Staff share wins, ask questions

### What Happens to Beta Staff After 6 Weeks?

**Option A: They stay in the program (RECOMMENDED)**
- Selar account stays active (they can review missions anytime)
- Telegram channel stays active (they continue receiving tips)
- When new cohort joins, beta staff become mentors/peer leaders
- **Cost:** ₦0 additional (Selar flat fee, Telegram free)

**Option B: They "graduate" out**
- Selar access revoked after 6 weeks
- Leave Telegram channel
- **Problem:** Lose refresher access, no onboarding tool for new hires
- **Not recommended unless budget forces it**

**Most likely:** Option A. Keep beta cohort active, they help onboard Wave 2.

## PHASE 2: Scale to 20 Staff (Full PRL Lekki)
**After Pilot Success, ~April 2026**

### The 13 New People:

**Selar enrollment:**
- Admin adds 13 new emails to Selar
- Missions unlock for them Mon/Wed/Fri (fresh start)
- They go through same 24 missions beta cohort completed
- **Key difference:** Content refined based on beta feedback (quiz questions clearer, examples adjusted)

**Telegram:**
- **Same channel** (no new channel created)
- 13 new staff join existing "PUMA Sales Mastery" channel
- Beta staff (original 7) are already there posting wins, answering questions
- Creates peer learning environment: "I did Mission 8 last week, here's what worked for me"

### The Original 7 Beta Staff:

**Selar:**
- Already completed 24 missions
- Can still log in to review content (refresher)
- May receive "bonus missions" (advanced techniques, new product launches)

**Telegram:**
- Stay in channel as active participants
- Become informal mentors for Wave 2
- Manager can spotlight them: "Ask Chidi about Mission 5, he nailed it"

**Benefit:** Accelerates Wave 2 learning (they see beta cohort modeling techniques)

---

## PHASE 3: Scale to 50 Staff (All PUMA Stores)
**If Phase 2 succeeds, ~Mid-2026**

### 30 New Staff Across 5 Locations:

**Selar enrollment:**
- Admin adds 30 new emails
- They go through same 24 missions (Missions 1-24)
- **Same content** (Layer 1 generic + PUMA Playbook reused)

**Telegram:**
- **Still same channel** (all 50 staff in one channel)
- OR: Create store-specific sub-channels if coordination becomes complex
  - **Option 1:** Single channel (50 people, may get noisy but builds community)
  - **Option 2:** Store-level channels (5 channels, 10 staff each, less crowded)
  - **Recommendation:** Try single channel first, split only if unmanageable

**Original 7 + Wave 2 (20 total):**
- All stay in Telegram channel
- Form "alumni" tier (help onboard Wave 3)
- May receive advanced content (Manager track, specialist training)

---

## PHASE 4: Add Second Brand (Lacoste, 40 Staff)
**If PUMA success proven**

### New Lacoste Staff:

**Selar enrollment:**
- 40 new emails added
- **Different content:** Layer 1 (same) + Layer 3 (Lacoste-specific Module 4)
- Missions 1-18 identical to PUMA
- Missions 19-24 customized (Lacoste products, objections, brand voice)

**Telegram:**
- **Separate channel:** "Lacoste Sales Mastery"
- Why separate? Different brand, different product catalog, different objections
- **No mixing PUMA + Lacoste** (confuses brand-specific content)

**PUMA Staff (50 people):**
- Stay in PUMA Telegram channel
- Not invited to Lacoste channel (brand separation)

## Summary: Who Goes Where

| Phase | Selar Users | Telegram Channel | What Happens to Previous Cohorts |
|-------|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Beta (7 staff)** | 7 enrolled | "PUMA Sales Mastery" (1 channel) | N/A |
| **Wave 2 (20 staff)** | 7 + 13 new = 20 total | Same channel | Original 7 stay, mentor Wave 2 |
| **Wave 3 (50 staff)** | 20 + 30 new = 50 total | Same channel (or split by store if needed) | All 20 stay, mentor Wave 3 |
| **Lacoste (40 staff)** | 40 new (separate enrollment) | NEW channel: "Lacoste Sales Mastery" | PUMA channel unaffected |

---

## Key Principles

### Selar (Learning Platform):
- **One program, multiple cohorts** (everyone sees same 24 missions)
- **Flat fee ₦12K/month** (7 users or 200 users, same cost)
- **Content improves over time** (quiz adjustments based on failure patterns)
- **Staff can stay enrolled indefinitely** (for refreshers, new hire onboarding)

### Telegram (Engagement):
- **One channel per brand** (PUMA channel, Lacoste channel)
- **NOT one channel per store/location** (builds community across locations)
- **Earlier cohorts mentor later cohorts** (peer learning accelerates Wave 2/3)
- **Manager posts daily** (tips, wins, mission unlock reminders)

---

## What This Looks Like in Practice

**March 15 (Beta ends):**
- 7 staff completed 24 missions
- Selar: "Do you want to revoke access?" → **No, keep them enrolled**
- Telegram: Channel stays active, daily tips continue

**April 10 (Wave 2 starts):**
- Admin enrolls 13 new emails in Selar
- Admin adds 13 new people to Telegram channel
- Manager posts: "Welcome to our 13 new team members! Original 7, help them out!"
- Beta staff: "Hey! I just finished Mission 8 last month, happy to answer questions"

**Wave 2 completion (June):**
- Now 20 staff completed program
- All 20 stay in Selar (refresher access)
- All 20 stay in Telegram (community + mentorship for Wave 3)

**Wave 3 starts (July):**
- Admin enrolls 30 new emails across 5 stores
- All 30 join same Telegram channel (or store-specific if too noisy)
- Manager coordinates cross-store peer learning

**Lacoste pilot (Aug):**
- **NEW Selar enrollment** (separate from PUMA, different Module 4)
- **NEW Telegram channel** (Lacoste-specific content)
- PUMA channel unaffected (continues independently)

## Cost Implications

**Beta → Wave 2 (7 → 20 staff):**
- Selar: Still ₦12K/month (flat fee!)
- Telegram: Free
- **Cost increase:** ₦0 for platform, only new cohort onboarding time

**Wave 2 → Wave 3 (20 → 50 staff):**
- Selar: Still ₦12K/month (!!!)
- Telegram: Free (unless you split into store channels, still free)
- **Cost increase:** Multi-store coordination, not platform cost

**Add Lacoste (40 staff):**
- Selar: Still ₦12K/month (same account, different course modules)
- Telegram: Free (second channel)
- **Cost increase:** Layer 3 content creation (₦1.8M), not platform

**This is why Selar's flat fee is magic.** Scale-up pricing is all labor/content, not platform.

## FAQ: Cohort Progression

**Q: Do beta staff need to redo training when Wave 2 starts?**
A: No. They've already completed it. They stay enrolled for refreshers but don't restart.

**Q: Can Wave 2 staff see beta staff's quiz scores?**
A: No. Selar keeps individual progress private. Only manager sees everyone's dashboard.

**Q: What if beta staff leave the company before Wave 2?**
A: Remove them from Selar (free up dashboard clutter) and Telegram. Doesn't affect platform cost.

**Q: Can we pause Selar subscription between cohorts?**
A: Yes, but you lose access for beta cohort (no refreshers). Better to keep active at ₦12K/month.

**Q: How do we prevent PUMA staff from seeing Lacoste content?**
A: Separate Selar course enrollment. PUMA staff enrolled in "PUMA Sales Mastery," Lacoste staff in "Lacoste Sales Mastery."

**Bottom line:** Beta staff don't "graduate out." They stay enrolled, mentor later cohorts, and everyone uses the same Telegram channel (per brand). This builds peer learning culture and maximizes flat-fee platform value.
