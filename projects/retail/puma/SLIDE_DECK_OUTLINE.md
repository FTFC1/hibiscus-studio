## SLIDE 2: The Problem (Visual: ₦ leaking from bucket)
**Revenue Leaking from Common Mistakes**

**Late/no customer acknowledgment:**
2 lost sales/day × ₦25K × 6 days × 52 weeks = **₦15.6M/year**

**"Can I help you?" shutting down conversations:**
5 lost sales/week × ₦25K × 52 weeks = **₦6.5M/year**

**Talking at customers (not listening):**
3 lost sales/week × ₦25K × 52 weeks = **₦3.9M/year**

**Total:** ₦26M/year preventable losses (7 staff)

## DESIGN NOTES (For Slide Creation)

**Visual Style:**
- Clean, minimal text (max 5 bullets per slide)
- PUMA brand colors (black, white, red accents)
- Icons for concepts (₦, phone, graph, shield)
- One clear visual per slide

**Font Hierarchy:**
- Slide titles: Large, bold
- Body text: Medium, readable
- Numbers: Extra large (₦45K, 98.5%, +₦1.68M)

**Flow:**
1. Problem (Slides 2)
2. Solution (Slides 3-5)
3. Investment (Slides 6)
4. Results (Slides 7)
5. Process (Slides 8-9)
6. Risk/Scale (Slides 10-13)
7. Close (Slides 14-15)

**Recommended Tool:**
- Google Slides (easy collaboration with business partner)
- Canva (retail-friendly templates)
- PowerPoint (if PUMA corporate standard)

**Key Principle:** Each slide = 1 concept. If you need to explain it, it's too complex.

**For email:** PDF + one-pager attached
**For print:** PDF with notes pages (add talking points)

## TALKING POINTS (Speaker Notes)

### Slide 2 (The Problem):
"These aren't made-up numbers. Research from Nike, Adidas, and luxury retail shows these patterns cost stores millions. We're targeting the low-hanging fruit—basic engagement failures that training can fix."

### Slide 6 (Investment):
"₦45K is essentially the cost of running the platform. We're waiving ₦2.955M because we need a recognized brand like PUMA to validate our methodology. This is a no-brainer for you—we're taking all the risk."

### Slide 7 (Expected Results):
"Conservative estimate: ₦1.68M/month increase from just 7 staff. If each staff increases their basket by 20%, that's ₦420K/week. The pilot pays for itself in Week 1."

### Slide 12 (Scale-Up):
"Here's where it gets interesting. The platform cost doesn't increase when you scale. ₦12K/month for 7 staff or 200 staff. So scale-up pricing is all labor and content—not infrastructure. That's why the economics work."

### Slide 15 (Next Steps):
"We need approval by Feb 1 to launch Feb 10. That gives us 9 days for setup. If you need more time, we can push to Feb 17, but every week delayed is ₦420K in lost revenue."
