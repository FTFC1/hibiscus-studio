# PUMA Sales Mastery Training Program
## Pilot Proposal - 7 Staff (PRL Lekki)

**Prepared for:** PUMA Nigeria
**Prepared by:** FORJE Training Solutions
**Date:** January 28, 2026
**Program Duration:** 6 weeks (Feb 3 - March 15, 2026)

---

## UPDATE: Feb 9 Decisions (Timi + Nicholas)

### Pricing Model — Monthly Volume Discount Per Store
- **1-5 stores:** ₦500,000/store/month (₦400,000 with 20% preferential discount — "working together on other projects")
- **6-10 stores:** ₦350,000/store/month (discount baked in)
- **10+ stores:** ₦250,000/store/month (= ₦50,000/person/month for 5-person store = "world-class retail training")
- **Model:** Volume play. NOT one-off upfront (traditional NG model = pay once, don't return). Monthly recurring.

### Trial Structure (2 months)
- **Delivery:** Telegram group for engagement, competition, feedback loop
- **Reports:** Regular reports from TG activity (scores, posts) + store conversion/order value data
- **No dashboard** at trial stage (extra build, needs to be paid for before designing)
- **Review meetings:** Monthly or fortnightly with store manager + head of sales
- **Accountability:** Progress tied to engagement. If they don't use it and say it doesn't work → increase enforcement
- **Requirements:** Phone with Telegram + internet access

### Demo Meeting (Thursday)
- **Wednesday:** Script/playbook prep with Timi
- **Thursday:** Demo to store team
- **Demo agenda:** (1) Platform walkthrough, (2) Custom-built for Puma products, (3) Certification plan, (4) Problems identified + solution, (5) Success metrics post-trial, (6) Trial length + requirements
- **Key:** Don't rush. Capture raw feedback on first play.

### Objections Timi Expects
1. **Cost** → Clear value breakdown. Binary: more money or not.
2. **"How do we know it works?"** → Engagement tracking proves usage. Reports show progress.
3. **Attribution** ("new products arrived, sales went up anyway") → Engagement data + conversion tracking. If they admit uptick, tie to training participation.

### Timi's Real Value Proposition
- Ongoing/continuous learning (not one-off)
- Being tested to show understanding
- Learning tracked, progress monitored
- "No other training in NG offers this today"

## Executive Summary

This pilot program addresses common sales challenges that cost retail stores significant revenue:

**Three preventable failure patterns:**

1. **Late or no customer acknowledgment**
   - Industry best practice: Acknowledge within 5 seconds, approach within 60 seconds
   - Common reality: Staff busy with tasks, customers browse alone for 3-5+ minutes
   - Impact per staff: ~2 lost sales/day = 12/week = ₦15.6M/year (at ₦25K average basket)

2. **Closed-ended greetings that shut down conversation**
   - "Can I help you?" → "No thanks, just looking" (90% of the time)
   - Results in customers browsing alone, leaving without assistance
   - Impact per staff: ~5 lost sales/week = ₦6.5M/year

3. **Talking at customers instead of listening**
   - Staff list features without understanding customer needs first
   - Customers feel overwhelmed, say "let me think about it"
   - Impact per staff: ~3 lost sales/week = ₦3.9M/year

**Combined conservative estimate:** ₦26M/year in preventable revenue leakage across 7 staff.

This 6-week training program targets **20-30% basket size increase** and **70%+ cross-sell attachment rate** through systematic customer engagement skills.

**Pilot Investment:** ₦45,000 (platform + data stipend)
**Training Program Value:** ₦2,500,000 (**₦2.455M waived for case study participation**)

---

## The Problem: Revenue Leakage from Untrained Staff

### Current State Analysis

| Failure Mode | Weekly Impact | Annual Loss |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Poor greeting/acknowledgment** | 12 lost sales × ₦25K | **₦15.6M** |
| **"Can I help you?" shutdowns** | 5 lost sales × ₦25K | **₦6.5M** |
| **Feature dumping (no listening)** | 3 lost sales × ₦25K | **₦3.9M** |
| **TOTAL PREVENTABLE LOSS** | | **₦26M/year** |

**These are skills gaps, not effort gaps.** Staff want to sell—they don't know how to engage customers systematically.

### Industry Benchmarks

**Top-performing sportswear retailers achieve:**
- 70%+ add-on attachment rate (socks, cleaners, accessories)
- ₦35-45K average basket vs. ₦25K
- 3-4 items per transaction vs. 1-2

**The gap is training.**

## Delivery Mechanism

### **Selar Learning Platform** (Primary LMS)

**Why Selar:**
- ✅ Nigeria-focused (Naira payments, mobile-optimized)
- ✅ Automated drip content (Mon/Wed/Fri mission unlocks)
- ✅ Built-in quizzes (validate comprehension, not just attendance)
- ✅ Real-time completion tracking (admin dashboard)
- ✅ Mobile-responsive (works on budget Android devices)
- ✅ Professional certificates upon module completion
- ✅ **Flat-fee pricing:** ₦12K/month unlimited users (scales to 50+ staff at same cost)

**Staff Experience:**
1. Receives email invite → creates Selar account (2 minutes)
2. Logs in Mon/Wed/Fri → new mission unlocked
3. Reads 1,000-word lesson on phone (8-10 minutes)
4. Takes 5-question quiz (pass: 80%+)
5. Completes practical task at work next day (manager signs off)
6. Next mission unlocks → repeat

**Management Dashboard:**
- Real-time completion % per staff
- Quiz scores (identifies knowledge gaps)
- Time spent per lesson (flags disengagement)
- Practical task submissions (photo + description)
- Last login timestamp (see who needs nudge)

### **Telegram Engagement Layer** (Community Support)

**Purpose:** Daily micro-content + peer accountability

**Content:**

- Peer challenges: "Share your best cross-sell story"
- Manager announcements: "Module 2 unlocks tomorrow!"
- Quick Q&A channel (staff ask, trainer/manager respond)

**Why hybrid approach works:**
- Selar = structure, tracking, validation
- Telegram = engagement, community, daily touchpoints

- **Pilot ROI:** ₦2.1M gain vs. ₦45K investment = **4,567% return in Month 1**

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Low completion rates (staff don't engage)

**Mitigation:**
- Manager accountability (weekly dashboard reviews)
- Telegram daily nudges (peer visibility creates social pressure)
- Data stipend (removes "using my own data" friction)
- Mobile-first design (10 mins/lesson, not 1-hour videos)
- Quiz-gated progression (can't skip ahead)

### Risk: Skills learned but not applied on floor

**Mitigation:**
- Practical tasks built into every mission (manager signs off)
- Weekly manager coaching calls (reinforce skills during floor time)
- Quick Reference cards (bookmark-able scripts for in-moment use)
- Peer sharing in Telegram (creates accountability + modeling)

### Risk: Platform technical issues (Android compatibility)

**Mitigation:**
- Pre-tested on ₦40K budget Android devices (Tecno, Infinix)
- Selar mobile-optimized (not heavy video-based)
- Telegram backup (if Selar down, training continues)
- 4-hour response time for technical support

### Risk: Training effects fade after 6 weeks

**Mitigation:**
- Manager coaching guide (how to sustain habits)
- Ongoing Telegram tips (micro-refreshers post-program)
- Optional refresher modules at 3-month mark (₦50K/cohort)
- Link training completion to performance reviews (PUMA HR decision)

---

---

## What PUMA Leadership Needs to Decide

### Option 1: Approve Pilot (₦45K, 7 staff, 6 weeks)
**Action:** Sign contract, provide staff emails, pay ₦45K
**Timeline:** Launch Feb 3
**Risk:** Low (₦45K investment, ₦2.755M value delivered)
**Outcome:** Data-driven decision on scale-up in 6 weeks

### Option 2: Decline Pilot
**Action:** No immediate action
**Risk:** Continue losing ₦26M/year from preventable sales failures
**Alternative:** Request custom proposal (different scope/timeline)

### Option 3: Skip Pilot, Go Straight to Scale (50 staff)
**Investment:** ₦1.294M for 12-month program
**Risk:** Higher upfront cost without pilot validation
**Benefit:** Faster ROI (all 50 staff trained by Week 6)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why waive ₦2.755M for this pilot?**
A: Case study credibility. PUMA is a recognized brand; demonstrating 20-30% basket lift with your team validates our methodology for future clients (Lacoste, multi-brand retailers, etc.).

**Q: What happens if pilot fails (no sales lift)?**
A: You've invested ₦45K. We've invested ₦2.8M in content/setup. Mutual risk. But industry benchmarks + research (Nike, Adidas, luxury retail) suggest 70%+ success rate for systematic training.

**Q: Can we get the training materials without the platform?**
A: No. The delivery mechanism (drip content, quizzes, tracking) is critical to outcomes. Content alone = shelf-ware. Structured delivery = behavior change.

**Q: What if staff leave after training?**
A: Selar account stays active (₦12K/month flat fee). New hires enroll at zero marginal cost. Content is evergreen.

**Q: Do we own the training content?**
A: PUMA-specific Module 4 (Playbook) is exclusive. Layer 1 content (generic retail skills) remains FORJE IP but licensed for unlimited internal PUMA use during subscription period.

**Q: Can we pause the subscription after 6 weeks?**
A: Yes. Cancel Selar anytime. But staff lose access to refresher content. Recommended: Keep active at ₦12K/month for onboarding new hires.
