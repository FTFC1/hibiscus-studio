# WhatsApp Message to Timi

## Version 1: With File Attachment

```
Hey Timi,

Put together the PUMA presentation deck - 15 slides covering the pilot.

Please scan it and let me know:
- What doesn't work
- What needs more explanation
- Questions PUMA leadership will have

I have full supporting docs ready for deeper dives, but want your initial reaction first so we can move quickly.

Open in any browser. Works on phone too.
