# Internal Case Study: The Nest

## Deal Shape
- **Client type:** Residential apartment block, Ikoyi
- **Decision structure:** 5-family investment group. Contact = analyst/reporter (not sole decision-maker). She collects quotes, analyzes, presents to group.
- **Need:** 2x 250kVA Perkins generators, 24/7 power, backup for existing aging fleet (Caterpillar 10+ years, Gradall 10+ years, White generator aging)
- **Budget range:** N12-13M per family (N60-65M total)
- **Competition:** JMG FG Wilson (N62.0M, 18mo warranty), Mantrac CAT (N77.6M), Genbrite John Deere (eliminated), JMG Eletromak (eliminated)

## Journey Phases
1. Inbound lead — someone comes to us
2. Assumed simple sell — standard quote process
3. Discovery: 7 competing quotes landed (not just us)
4. Discovery: buyer is analyst for 5-family group (changes dynamics completely)
5. She shares pieces of competitors' quotes, asks for updates
6. Need to make analysis look professional — used Variant UI for design
7. Built comprehensive THE_NEST_Full_Analysis.pdf with AI tools (Claude)
8. WARRANTY SHOCK: Perkins has 1-year warranty, not 4-year as assumed
9. Ran discount math: need 33% off list (N84.27M) to be competitive
10. Waiting for Monday — new info expected, need manager approval on discount

## Tools Used
- **What tools:** Claude Code (analysis, math, extraction), Variant UI (PDF design), Excel price list (Gen Prices AN.xlsx)
- **What was annoying:** Warranty assumption went unchecked until late — built entire argument on false premise
- **What formats worked for sharing:** Professional PDF with visual slides (quote comparison tables, two-path analysis, year-2 breakdown scenarios)
- **What didn't work:** Pure text/email would not have worked — visual format was essential for 5-family committee decision

## Time Collapse
- **What would have taken X without tools:** Manual quote comparison across 7 vendors, calculating VAT/transport/per-family splits, designing presentation — easily 2-3 days
- **What it actually took:** ~2-3 hours with AI assistance
- **Where time was saved:** Competitive analysis table, discount scenario modeling, per-family cost calculations, professional formatting

## Price Collapse
- **Starting position:** N64.3M total at 29% discount (standard SP)
- **Where we need to land:** N60.7M at 33% discount to beat JMG
- **What moved the needle:** Warranty reality check forced price to do the work instead. N3.6M reduction needed.

## Gap Filled
- **What they had before:** 7 raw vendor quotes with different formats, no way to compare apples-to-apples
- **What they have now:** Single professional analysis with normalized comparison (same kVA, same cost structure, same scenario modeling)
- **The gap:** Translation layer between raw vendor data and investment-grade decision document

## Learnings
- **What to repeat:** AI-assisted competitive analysis is a weapon — speed + depth + professional output
- **What to avoid:** VERIFY WARRANTY CLAIMS BEFORE BUILDING ARGUMENTS. The 4-to-1 year discovery almost sank the deal.
- **What surprised us:** The buyer's role as "analyst for committee" — changes selling entirely. You're not selling to a buyer, you're arming an analyst with ammunition.

## Reuse Potential
- **Applicable to:** Any multi-quote generator deal (Mikano), any committee/group purchase decision
- **Template/artifact to extract:** Competitive analysis PDF template (quote table + paths + scenario modeling + economics)
- **Pattern identified:** "Analyst-buyer" = a distinct buyer type. Needs: ammunition, not persuasion. Professional formatting matters more than relationship in this context.
