# Session Packet: EP Framework Business Positioning

**Session Date:** 2026-01-30
**Project:** Aloe Labs (Automation + Training Services)
**Status:** 🟡 Strategic Framework Applied

---

## Core Insight

> "Seeing what people need and then packaging as a business after having done it is smarter way to move"

You're validating through actual client work FIRST, then building marketing around proof. This is the EP way.

---

## Business Architecture

```
ALOE LABS (parent brand)
├── Automation Systems (HB Studio, Motor Stock)
│   └── "I free up 10-15 hours/week so you can take on more clients"
│
└── Training Systems (PUMA, Retail L&D)
    └── "30-Day Seller Sprint - onboarding + refresher for retail teams"
```

**Key Distinction:**
- Automation = capacity problem (hitting ceiling, can't scale)
- Training = ramp-up problem (new hires too slow, veterans rusty)

Different buyers, different pain points, different landing pages.

---

## EP Module 2: Problem → Desire → Solution

### **AUTOMATION SERVICE**

| Framework Element | Before EP | After EP |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Problem** | "Manual work" | "Hitting capacity ceiling - turning down clients" |
| **Desire** | "Automation" ❌ | "Take on 30% more clients without hiring" ✅ |
| **Solution** | 7-10 day sprint | 10-Hour Buyback Sprint |
| **Packaging** | "Eliminate manual work" | "I automate your 3 most repetitive tasks. Outcome: 10+ hours back per week. Guarantee: 10 hours or another week free." |

### **TRAINING SERVICE**

| Framework Element | Before EP | After EP |
|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Problem** | "Untrained staff" | "New hires take 6 months to hit quota. Veterans haven't trained in 2 years." |
| **Desire** | "Better training" ❌ | "New hires hitting quota in 30 days. Veterans reactivated." ✅ |
| **Solution** | Mobile course | 30-Day Seller Sprint (works for onboarding + refresher) |
| **Packaging** | "PUMA retail training" | "Mobile course (5 lessons + 3 games). Outcome: Hit ₦500k/month in 30 days vs 6 months. Includes manager dashboard + certification badges." |

**Key Shift:** Stop selling the method (automation, training). Start selling the outcome (more capacity, faster ramp-up).

## EP Modules 3-6 (High-Level Application)

### **Module 3: Grand Slam Offers**
*Make it so good they feel stupid saying no*

**Automation Stack:**
- 10-Hour Buyback Sprint
- ✚ 30-day support
- ✚ Process documentation
- ✚ Loom walkthrough
- ✚ Guarantee: 10 hours back or another week free

**Training Stack:**
- 30-Day Seller Sprint
- ✚ Manager dashboard (track completion)
- ✚ Certification badges
- ✚ 90-day access (re-run for new hires)
- ✚ Guarantee: 50% faster ramp-up or you don't pay

### **Module 4: Pricing & Value**
*Charge based on outcome value, not your time*

**Automation Pricing:**
- ❌ "$X for 7-10 days of work"
- ✅ "I save you 10 hours/week = 40 hours/month. At ₦50/hour = ₦2,000/month value. I charge ₦5,000 once. Break even in 2.5 months."

**Training Pricing:**
- ❌ "$X per learner"
- ✅ "New hire takes 6 months to hit ₦500k/month = ₦3M lost revenue. I get them there in 30 days for ₦300k. Save ₦2.7M per hire."

### **Module 5: Lead Generation**
*Who to target and where to find them*

**Automation Target:**
- Studio/agency owners (₦5M-₦30M/year)
- LinkedIn, HB referrals, industry groups
- **Action:** Get 1 more client (total of 3) → THEN build landing page

**Training Target:**
- L&D managers at retail brands (20+ stores)
- LBS network, LinkedIn, retail conferences
- **Action:** Convert PUMA → Get 2 more → THEN build landing page

**EP Insight:** Don't build marketing before you have 3 customers.

### **Module 6: Sales Conversations**
*How to close without being salesy*

**Automation Question:**
"What's the one task eating the most time in your week?"
→ "What if I could automate that in 7 days? Here's what I did for HB Studio..."

**Training Question:**
"How long does it take a new hire to hit their first ₦500k month?"
→ "What if I could cut that in half? Here's the PUMA demo..."

## Current State Analysis

### **Automation Service**
- ✅ 2 case studies (HB Studio, Motor Stock)
- ✅ Portfolio built (automation-portfolio-hud-style.html)
- 🟡 Need 1 more client before landing page
- **Next:** Send portfolio to 10 prospects, track responses

### **Training Service**
- 🟡 1 demo prospect (PUMA - not paying yet)
- ✅ Training demo built (puma-training-demo)
- 🔴 Need PUMA to convert + 2 more clients before landing page
- **Next:** Show PUMA demo this week, get feedback

## Key EP Teachings Applied

### **"Sell them what they WANT, give them what they NEED"**
- Want: More capacity / Faster ramp-up
- Need: Automation / Training

### **"Most people fail because they're keeping their options open"**
- Don't build both landing pages now
- Test automation first (30 days) → If it works, double down
- If PUMA converts, test training second

### **"The market is smarter than you. Let it tell you what to build."**
- You've done the work (HB, Motor, PUMA)
- Now TEST with real convos before building more marketing
- Client feedback > your assumptions

### **PUMA Positioning Insight**
- Not just onboarding - also REFRESHER
- PUMA hasn't done physical training in 2+ years
- Reframe as **"Reactivation Sprint"** → solves 2 problems (new hires + rusty veterans)

---

## Recommended Sequence (EP Way)

### **Next 14 Days:**
1. Send automation portfolio to 10 studio/agency owners
2. Show PUMA the training demo
3. Track: opens, replies, calls, objections

### **Days 15-30:**
**IF automation converts:**
- Get 1 more automation client (now have 3 case studies)
- Build automation landing page
- Double down on automation outreach

**IF PUMA buys:**
- Use PUMA as case study
- Reach out to 2 more retail brands (LBS network)
- Get 2 more clients → THEN build training landing page

**IF both work:**
- Automation is primary revenue (more scalable)
- Training is secondary (info product, easier close)
- Build automation page first, training page second

## Business Philosophy Validated

**Your Approach:**
> "Seeing what people need and then packaging as a business after having done it"

**Why This Works (EP Framework):**
1. You validate demand BEFORE building marketing
2. You have proof (case studies) from day 1
3. You know the exact pain points (you've lived them)
4. You can price based on real outcomes (not guesses)

**Contrast with "Build It and They Will Come":**
- ❌ Build landing page → hope for clients
- ✅ Get clients → build landing page around proof

You're already doing the smart move. Just need to formalize it.
