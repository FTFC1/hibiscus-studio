## **AUTOMATION SERVICE**

### The Ask:
"What's the one task eating the most time in your week?"

### The Outcome:
"I free up 10-15 hours/week so you can take on more clients without hiring"

### The Offer:
**10-Hour Buyback Sprint**
- 7-10 days, done-for-you
- Automate your 3 most repetitive tasks
- Includes: 30-day support, docs, Loom walkthrough
- Guarantee: 10 hours back or another week free

### The Pricing:
"You get 10 hours back per week = 40 hours/month. At ₦50/hour, that's ₦2,000/month in buyback. I charge ₦5,000 once. Break even in 2.5 months."

### The Close:
"I did this for HB Studio and Motor Stock. Want to see the before/after?"

## **TRAINING SERVICE**

### The Ask:
"How long does it take a new hire to hit their first ₦500k month?"

### The Outcome:
"Turn new hires into ₦500k/month sellers in 30 days instead of 6 months"
(Also works as refresher for veterans)

### The Offer:
**30-Day Seller Sprint**
- Mobile course: 5 lessons + 3 games
- Includes: Manager dashboard, certification badges, 90-day access
- Works for onboarding AND reactivation
- Guarantee: 50% faster ramp-up or you don't pay

### The Pricing:
"New hire takes 6 months to hit ₦500k = ₦3M in lost revenue potential. I get them there in 30 days for ₦300k. You save ₦2.7M per hire."

### The Close:
"This is what PUMA is testing. Want to see the demo?"

## **EP'S CORE RULE**

**Don't sell the method. Sell the outcome.**

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|---------|---------|
| "I do automation" | "I free up 10 hours/week" |
| "I build training courses" | "I cut ramp-up time in half" |
| "7-10 day sprint" | "10-hour buyback guarantee" |
| "Mobile learning" | "New hires hit quota in 30 days" |

---

## **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

Before building landing page:

**Automation:**
- [ ] 3 paying clients secured
- [ ] All 3 got 10+ hours back
- [ ] Can articulate their exact pain points

**Training:**
- [ ] PUMA converted (paying)
- [ ] 2 more retail brands signed
- [ ] Can show before/after ramp-up times

**Then and only then:** Build landing page with proof.

---

## **NEXT 30 DAYS**

**Week 1-2:** Send automation portfolio to 10 prospects
**Week 2:** Show PUMA training demo
**Week 3-4:** Follow up, track objections, adjust messaging

**After 30 days:** Review which service got more traction → double down on winner.
