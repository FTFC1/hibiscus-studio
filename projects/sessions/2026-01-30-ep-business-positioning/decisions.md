# Strategic Decisions: EP Framework Application

**Session Date:** 2026-01-30

## Decision 1: Two-Service Architecture Confirmed

**Context:**
User asked if PUMA work fits automation portfolio. Answer: No, different buyer.

**Decision:**
- Keep automation and training as SEPARATE services under Aloe Labs parent brand
- Build separate landing pages when ready (after validation)
- Each service targets different pain point and buyer persona

**Rationale (EP):**
- Automation buyers have capacity problems (hitting ceiling)
- Training buyers have ramp-up problems (slow onboarding)
- Mixing them = confused positioning = weaker close rate

**Status:** ✅ Confirmed

---

## Decision 2: Reframe from Method to Outcome

**Context:**
Current positioning sells the HOW (automation, training) instead of the WHY (outcomes).

**Decision:**

### Automation Service:
- ❌ OLD: "I eliminate manual work"
- ✅ NEW: "I free up 10-15 hours/week so you can take on more clients without hiring"

### Training Service:
- ❌ OLD: "PUMA retail training"
- ✅ NEW: "30-Day Seller Sprint - turn new hires into ₦500k/month sellers in 30 days vs 6 months"

**Rationale (EP Module 2):**
"Sell them what they WANT (the outcome), give them what they NEED (the solution)."

Nobody wants automation or training. They want more capacity and faster ramp-up.

**Status:** ✅ Applied to positioning

## Decision 3: Test Before Building Marketing

**Context:**
User has portfolio built, demo built, but limited client validation.

**Decision:**
- DON'T build automation landing page until 3 clients secured (currently have 2)
- DON'T build training landing page until PUMA converts + 2 more clients
- Outreach with existing assets (portfolio, demo) for next 30 days
- Track responses to validate demand

**Rationale (EP Module 5):**
"Don't build marketing until you have 3 customers."

You're building marketing → hoping for clients (wrong order).
EP does: Get clients → build marketing around proof.

**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (testing phase starts this week)

---

## Decision 4: Automation First, Training Second

**Context:**
User said "automation is more scalable but I'd like to see what both look like."

**Decision:**
- Test automation outreach FIRST (next 14 days)
- Test training outreach SECOND (days 15-30)
- Don't split focus across both simultaneously

**Rationale (EP):**
"Most people fail because they're keeping their options open. Commitment is the ultimate edge."

Testing both at once = diluted focus = slower validation.

**Status:** 🟡 Awaiting user confirmation to proceed

---

## Decision 5: PUMA Positioning Shift

**Context:**
User clarified: "PUMA is onboarding but also refresher. They haven't done physical training in over 2 years."

**Decision:**
Reframe PUMA training as **"Reactivation Sprint"**:
- Works for NEW HIRES (onboarding)
- Works for VETERANS (refresher after 2-year gap)
- Solves TWO problems with one product

**Rationale:**
Bigger problem = bigger value = easier close.

"We haven't trained in 2 years" = veterans are rusty = missed quota = lost revenue.
Now you're solving onboarding AND reactivation, not just onboarding.

**Status:** ✅ Applied to positioning framework

---

## Decision 6: Value-Based Pricing Over Time-Based

**Context:**
Currently pricing based on effort (7-10 day sprint, X per learner).

**Decision:**

### Automation Pricing:
Anchor to OUTCOME VALUE:
"I save you 10 hours/week = 40 hours/month at ₦50/hour = ₦2,000/month in buyback. I charge ₦5,000 once. Break even in 2.5 months, profit forever."

### Training Pricing:
Anchor to COST OF PROBLEM:
"New hire takes 6 months to hit ₦500k/month = ₦3M lost revenue. I get them there in 30 days for ₦300k total. You save ₦2.7M per hire."

**Rationale (EP Module 4):**
"Charge based on outcome value, not your time."

Time-based pricing = you're selling hours (commodity).
Value-based pricing = you're selling results (premium).

**Status:** 🟡 Framework applied, not yet tested in real pricing conversations

---

## Decision 7: Portfolio vs Landing Page Strategy

**Context:**
User noted: "Building up to a landing page makes closing tabs easier because you have all the stuff in one place."

**Decision:**
- Portfolio = working asset for conversations NOW
- Landing page = future asset after 3 clients secured
- Use portfolio for outreach, test messaging, gather objections
- Build landing page AFTER you know what messages convert

**Rationale:**
Portfolio gets you started today. Landing page optimization comes after validation.

**Status:** ✅ Portfolio exists and ready for outreach

---

## Open Questions

1. **Which service will user test first?** (Automation vs Training)
2. **When will PUMA see the demo?** (User said "PUMA hasn't seen it yet")
3. **Is Motor Stock a paying client?** (Confirmed HB is paying, Motor unclear)

---

## Philosophy Validated

**User's Insight:**
> "This approach of seeing what people need and then packaging as a business after having done it is smarter way to move."

**EP Validation:**
This IS the EP way. You're doing:
1. Solve real problem for real client (HB, Motor, PUMA)
2. Document what worked
3. Package it as repeatable service
4. Test with 3 more clients
5. THEN build marketing at scale

vs. the wrong way:
1. Build marketing
2. Hope someone buys
3. Figure out how to deliver
4. Realize your positioning was wrong
5. Start over

**You're already ahead.** Just need to formalize the testing phase.
