# Session Packet: Nigerian Profiling Strategy Evaluation

**Session Date:** 2026-02-06
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** ~1.5h
**Work Type:** Research + Planning

---

## CONTEXT

User shared 1,775-line ChatGPT conversation about DSG profiling methodology for Nigerian generator sales. ChatGPT provided elaborate profiling frameworks (Motion Score, Stress Score, BTL triangulation, 8-minute call stacks, etc.).

User's question: "Is ChatGPT valid or being overly skeptical? Also, Fisayo won't know about projects/motion at other firms."

Need to evaluate the ChatGPT stance and identify the **actual leverage point** vs theoretical frameworks.

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. ChatGPT Framework Overcomplicated (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** ChatGPT's elaborate scoring systems (Motion 0-3, Stress 0-3, Source Confidence 0-3) are overkill for remote-only, small operation.

**Why:**
- Assumes BTL access user doesn't have
- Assumes ability to triangulate across multiple firms
- Created theoretical profiling methodology without practical Nigerian execution paths
- 40% valid insights, 60% overthinking

**What Was Valid:**
- Nigerian context needs softer approach ✅
- Triangulation matters ✅
- "Motion" detection vs static claims ✅
- Pattern-based positioning ✅

**What Was Overcomplicated:**
- BTL profiling systems requiring firm-level intel ❌
- Elaborate scoring rubrics ❌
- Assumed deep knowledge from boutique architect about competitor firms ❌

**Impact:** Prevented user from building elaborate systems that wouldn't work in practice

---

### 2. Real Leverage = Fisayo's Network Access (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** The actual value is **Fisayo telling you WHICH FIRMS + WARM PATHS**, not elaborate profiling methodology.

**Why:**
- Fisayo can name 3-5 firms that handle generator-heavy projects
- Fisayo can tell you if he knows people there (warm intro path)
- This is worth 10x more than remote profiling systems
- Nigerian sales = relationship-driven (ChatGPT acknowledged but didn't execute on)

**Simplified Approach:**
1. Ask Fisayo: "Which firms should I focus on?"
2. Ask Fisayo: "Do you know people at those firms?"
3. Use warm intro positioning when available
4. Cold outreach (with EstateIntel validation) when not

**Impact:** Shifts from theoretical profiling frameworks to practical network leverage

---

### 3. Message to Fisayo: Casual + Direct (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Keep message casual Nigerian professional, acknowledge overthinking, ask for practical guidance.

**Format:**
```
Good Evening Uncle Fisayo,

Question.

Which architectural firms should I be focusing on? The ones that do estates, hotels, commercial buildings — projects that need real generator capacity.

And do you know people at any of those firms? Even if just casually — would help me know how to approach them properly.

I've been reading about profiling strategies and realized I might be overthinking it. Better to ask someone who knows the landscape.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Casual, respectful ("Uncle Fisayo")
- Direct question with context
- Acknowledges his expertise
- Gives him easy ways to help (firm names + contact warmth check)
- No pressure, no elaborate framework

**Impact:** Gets actionable firm names + warm intro paths instead of theoretical methodology

## WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. ChatGPT Evaluation Framework
**Location:** Session packet (above)

**Content:**
- What ChatGPT got right (4 valid points)
- What ChatGPT overcomplicated (3 problem areas)
- What ChatGPT completely missed (network leverage)
- Verdict: 40% valid, 60% overthinking

### 2. Simplified Fisayo Outreach Message
**Location:** Session packet (above)

**Content:**
- Casual Nigerian professional tone
- "Good Evening Uncle Fisayo, Question." opening
- Direct ask: Which firms? Know anyone there?
- Acknowledges overthinking (builds trust)

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

### CLAUDE.md
**Change:** Added Notion MCP workaround section

**Content:**
- Issue: Notion MCP JSON parsing bug (treats properties as character indices)
- Workaround: Direct API calls via curl + JSON files
- Pattern: Extract token from .mcp.json → curl with payload
- Reference: Feb 6, 2026 (Mario Abugo profile update)

**Why:** Prevents future time waste when updating Notion database properties

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- **Prevented elaborate system building** — User was about to implement ChatGPT's complex scoring rubrics
- **Identified real leverage** — Fisayo's network access (firm names + warm paths) > profiling methodology
- **Simplified execution** — From elaborate BTL triangulation → simple firm recommendations + positioning

### Foundational
- **Pattern recognized** — Theoretical frameworks often miss practical leverage points in relationship-driven markets
- **Nigerian B2B clarity** — Network access > elaborate profiling when operating remote-only
- **Message template** — Casual + direct approach for asking experts to cut through noise

---

## OPEN ITEMS

1. **Send message to Fisayo** — Get firm recommendations + warm intro paths
2. **Update Notion DSG database** — Add "Recommended by Fisayo" field for tracking warm paths
3. **EstateIntel research** — Once Fisayo provides firm names, validate activity via EstateIntel before outreach

---

## META

**Pattern Observed:**
When experts provide elaborate frameworks, check if they're solving the wrong problem. ChatGPT optimized for profiling methodology when the real constraint was network access.

**Lesson:**
In relationship-driven markets (Nigeria), **who you know** beats **what you know** 10:1. Theory < Practice.

Real leverage: "Fisayo, which firms?" > "Here's a 3-axis scoring rubric for BTL profiling."

**Application:**
Before building systems, ask: "What's the actual constraint?" Often it's access, not methodology.

**Sources (80/20):**
◇ 70% — ChatGPT conversation (1,775 lines, DSG profiling methodology)
◇ 20% — HUD context (generator sales strategy pivot, Fisayo referral model)
◇ 10% — User clarification (Fisayo won't know competitor firm details)
