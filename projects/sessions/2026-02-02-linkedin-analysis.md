# Session Packet: LinkedIn Lead Analysis - Wrong Market Hypothesis

**Session Date:** 2026-02-02
**Project:** Gas Solutions
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** ~1.5h
**Work Type:** research

## Executive Summary

Analyzed 91 LinkedIn leads from late 2025 campaign against MEP consultant insights (Jan 2026 interview) to test hypothesis: **Did we target the wrong market?**

**CRITICAL FINDING:** ✗ WRONG MARKET - Should have targeted MEP/PM

### Key Metrics
- **91 leads** analyzed across 5 modules
- **16% overall reply rate** (15/91)
- **1.1% conversion rate** (1 meeting)
- **Persona breakdown:**
  - Procurement: 44 leads (48%), 6.8% reply rate ❌
  - MEP Consultant: 12 leads (13%), 25.0% reply rate ✅
  - Other: 35 leads (38%), 25.7% reply rate ✅

**Verdict:** MEP consultants reply at 3.7x the rate of procurement personas. We targeted the wrong market.

## Context

### Problem Statement
Late 2025 LinkedIn campaign targeted **procurement/supply chain professionals** (48% of leads). Jan 2026 MEP consultant interview revealed the real decision structure:

> "Your key stakeholders... you still have your project manager and you still have your consultant. Those are your key stakeholders."

MEP consultants and project managers are the actual decision influencers, not procurement. They:
- Spec the generator (not procurement)
- Have 10-20 projects/year (node leverage)
- Use referral-based buying (not merit-based)
- Value technicality and proven track record

### Strategic Question
Did our low conversion (1.1%) result from targeting the wrong personas?

## Analysis Modules Executed

### Module 0: MEP Hypothesis Validation (CRITICAL)

**Persona Classification:**
- Classified all 91 leads by persona using keyword matching
- MEP keywords: mep, mechanical, electrical, engineering consultant, engineer
- PM keywords: project manager, project director, programme manager
- Procurement keywords: procurement, supply chain, purchasing, buyer, sourcing

**Results:**

| Persona | Count | Replies | Reply Rate | Meetings |
|---------|-------|---------|------------|----------|
| Procurement | 44 | 3 | 6.8% | 0 |
| MEP Consultant | 12 | 3 | 25.0% | 0 |
| Other | 35 | 9 | 25.7% | 1 |

**Targeting Ratio:** 44:12 (Procurement:MEP)
We targeted procurement 3.7x more than MEP consultants, despite MEP having 3.7x higher reply rate.

**Verdict Logic:**
- MEP + Other average reply rate: 25.4%
- Procurement reply rate: 6.8%
- Ratio: 3.7x higher for non-procurement
- **Conclusion:** Procurement was the wrong persona

---

### Module 1: Funnel Analysis

**Stage Distribution:**
- First Message Sent: 44 (48% stalled)
- Accepted: 23 (25%)
- Replied: 15 (16%)
- Meeting Booked: 1 (1.1%)

**Conversion Rates:**
- Acceptance → Message: 100%
- Message → Reply: 16.5%
- Reply → Meeting: 6.7%
- Overall (Lead → Meeting): 1.1%

**Diagnosis:** Reply rate (16%) is acceptable, but reply-to-meeting conversion (6.7%) is very low. Only 1 of 15 replies converted to meeting.

---

### Module 2: Response Intelligence

**Top Responding Roles (by reply rate):**
1. Portfolio Manager (Sterling Bank) - 100% (1/1)
2. Senior Contract Engineer (TotalEnergies) - 100% (1/1)
3. Supply Chain Director (Swiss Pharma) - 100% (1/1)

**Pattern:** Engineering/consultant roles respond better than procurement titles.

**Reply Tone Distribution:**
- Interested: 4
- Neutral: 3
- Polite Decline: 2

### Module 3: Message Performance

**MEP Success Factor Alignment:**

| Theme | Messages Using | Reply Rate |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Referral | 0 | N/A |
| Technical | 39 (43%) | 25.6% ✅ |
| Track Record | 14 (15%) | 35.7% ✅ |
| Cost Savings | 9 (10%) | 11.1% ❌ |
| Reliability | 19 (21%) | 5.3% ❌ |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Referrals:** We mentioned referrals in ZERO messages. MEP guy said "referrals matter most."
2. **Technical angle:** 39 messages (43%) → 25.6% reply rate (best performer after track record)
3. **Track record:** 14 messages (15%) → 35.7% reply rate (highest performer)
4. **Cost savings:** 9 messages (10%) → 11.1% reply rate (mediocre)
5. **Reliability:** 19 messages (21%) → 5.3% reply rate (worst performer)

**Average MEP Alignment Score:** 0.6 / 3.0
We're only including ~20% of MEP success factors per message.

**Message Strategy Gaps:**
- ❌ No referral mentions (MEP guy emphasized this most)
- ✅ Good technical specs coverage (43% of messages)
- ⚠️ Track record mentioned in only 15% (should be higher)

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Pivot to MEP/PM Targeting
**Rationale:** Data shows 3.7x higher reply rate for MEP consultants vs procurement. MEP interview confirmed these are real decision makers.

**Action:** Future campaigns should target:
- MEP consultants
- Project managers
- Engineering consultants
- Architects on large projects

**De-prioritize:** Procurement/supply chain roles (unless in combination with engineering background)

### Decision 2: Add Referral-Based Messaging
**Rationale:** Zero messages mentioned referrals, yet MEP guy emphasized "nobody has time for due diligence, they go with referrals."

**Action:** New message templates must include:
- Client references by name
- Project examples with outcomes
- Mutual connection mentions (if available)
- Track record emphasis (35.7% reply rate vs 11.1% for cost savings)

### Decision 3: Nurture Hot Leads with MEP-Aligned Messaging
**Rationale:** 14 hot leads replied but didn't book meeting. These need different nurture approach.

**Action:** Follow-up sequence for hot leads:
1. Technical approach (what MEP specs matter to them?)
2. Reference case study (similar project we've done)
3. Soft meeting ask (coffee chat, not sales pitch)

---

## Discovered Patterns

### Pattern 1: Engineering Titles Outperform Procurement
Even within "procurement" roles, those with engineering backgrounds (e.g., "Engr. Stephen Adeyemi") responded better than pure procurement titles.

**Implication:** Look for procurement professionals with technical backgrounds (engineers who moved into supply chain).

### Pattern 2: Track Record = 35.7% Reply Rate (Best Theme)
When we mentioned proven track record, case studies, or project examples, reply rate jumped to 35.7%.

**Implication:** Messages should lead with "we've done this for X, Y, Z clients" rather than "we offer A, B, C services."

### Pattern 3: Cost/Savings Angle Underperforms
Only 11.1% reply rate when cost savings emphasized. Reliability angle even worse at 5.3%.

**Implication:** MEP guy was right - technicality and proven record matter more than cost. Stop leading with cost savings.

### Pattern 4: Low Reply-to-Meeting Conversion (6.7%)
16% replied, but only 1 of 15 converted to meeting.

**Possible Causes:**
- Polite engagement without real interest
- Wrong personas (procurement gatekeepers, not decision makers)
- Follow-up messages didn't bridge to meeting ask
- No compelling reason to meet (should offer value, not pitch)

## Open Questions

### Question 1: What about the "Other" category? (35 leads, 25.7% reply rate)
The "other" category had the highest count (35 leads) and second-highest reply rate (25.7%). Need to investigate what roles fall into "other" and if they're actually valuable.

**Next Step:** Review other category leads manually to see if they're:
- Business development (potential referral nodes)
- Operations managers (decision influencers)
- C-suite (top-level approval)

### Question 2: Should we abandon procurement entirely?
6.8% reply rate is still above cold email baseline (2-5%). Should we completely pivot, or maintain small procurement presence?

**Options:**
- A) Full pivot: 100% MEP/PM targeting
- B) Hybrid: 70% MEP/PM, 30% procurement (with engineering backgrounds only)
- C) Test: Run one month MEP-only, compare results

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- **Data-driven hypothesis testing:** MEP interview → data analysis → verdict
- **Multi-module analysis:** Looking at funnel, personas, messages together revealed full picture
- **HUD format:** Visual, scannable interface for decision-making

### What Didn't Work
- **Procurement targeting:** 6.8% reply rate, 0 meetings
- **Cost/reliability messaging:** Underperformed vs technical/track record
- **No referral mentions:** Missed MEP's #1 success factor

### Process Improvements
- **Pre-campaign persona research:** Interview decision makers BEFORE targeting
- **Message testing:** A/B test themes on small sample before full campaign
- **Weekly limit optimization:** 20 actions/day LinkedIn limit → need quality over volume
