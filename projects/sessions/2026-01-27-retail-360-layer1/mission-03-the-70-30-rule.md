# Mission 3: The 70/30 Rule

**⏱️ Time:** 6-8 minutes
**🎯 What you'll learn:** How to understand what customers actually need (instead of dumping product features on them)

---

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

Customer says they're looking for running shoes.

You take them to the running section and start talking:

"This one has React foam for cushioning. This one has a carbon fiber plate for speed. This one is for trail running. This one is the new colorway from the latest collection. This one breathes better. This one—"

Customer's eyes glaze over. They nod along. They say "let me think about it." They leave.

What just happened?

**You feature-dumped.** You talked at them, not with them. You showed off your product knowledge instead of solving their problem.

And you lost the sale.

## 💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES

A Nike manager described this exact issue:

> "They don't listen to the customer to find out what the customer is actually looking for and focus on that. They just give their full spiel, and they don't identify—okay, this is a customer who's in his 40s, he needs more support."

Here's what happens when you talk more than you listen:

**1. The customer is overwhelmed**
Too many options. Too much information. They can't process it all. Decision paralysis kicks in. "I'll think about it" = "I need to escape."

**2. You miss the real need**
They wanted shoes for their sore back. You showed them 5 options based on style. You never solved their actual problem.

**3. You lose trust**
The customer senses you're not listening. They feel like you're trying to move product, not help them. That kills trust fast.

**4. You can't handle objections later**
When they say "I'll think about it," you don't know what they're thinking about. You never found out what actually mattered to them.

**Real cost calculation:**
- 3 sales killed/week by feature-dumping
- 3 sales × ₦25,000 average basket = **₦75,000/week lost**
- ₦75,000/week × 52 weeks = **₦3.9 million/year lost**

Just from talking at customers instead of listening to them.

## ✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

### The 70/30 Rule

**In the browsing phase:**
- **Customer should talk 70% of the time**
- **You should talk 30% of the time**

If you're doing most of the talking, you're doing it wrong.

Your job is to:
1. **Ask questions**
2. **Listen to answers**
3. **Ask follow-up questions**
4. **THEN** recommend based on what you learned

Not:
1. Show them everything
2. Talk about features
3. Hope something sticks

## 🎯 THE 4 QUESTIONS FRAMEWORK

Before you show a single product, understand these four things:

### Question 1: THE OCCASION
"What are you buying for?"

Not "I need shoes" — dig deeper. "I'm running my first marathon" or "I need something for work that's comfortable" or "My old ones fell apart."

**Why it matters:** The occasion tells you context—how they'll use it, what matters.

**Follow-ups:**
- "Where will you be wearing this?"
- "What activities do you need this for?"
- "What's coming up that made you come in today?"

---

### Question 2: THE PROBLEM
"What's not working with what you have now?"

Every customer is here because something isn't working. Find out what.

**Why it matters:** The problem tells you which features actually matter (and which don't).

**Follow-ups:**
- "What do you wish your current [item] did better?"
- "Have you tried anything before that didn't work?"
- "What's frustrating you about your current setup?"

**Example:**
- You: "What made you want new running shoes?"
- Customer: "My knees have been killing me."
- You: **[Now you know]** → Show cushioned shoes, not speed shoes.

---

### Question 3: THE PRIORITY
"What matters most—comfort, durability, or style?"

Everyone weighs these differently. Some people don't care what it looks like if it's comfortable. Others need it to look good above everything else.

**Why it matters:** This tells you how to frame your recommendation.

**Follow-ups:**
- "Do you have a budget in mind?"
- "Is brand important to you?"
- "Are you looking for something that'll last years, or just this season?"

---

### Question 4: THE DECISION CONTEXT
"Are you hoping to leave with something today?"

Are they buying today or researching? Buying for themselves or others? Alone or need to consult someone?

**Why it matters:** This tells you how urgently to push, whether to suggest they bring someone back, whether to get their number for follow-up.

**Follow-ups:**
- "Is this for you or someone else?"
- "Is there anyone else involved in the decision?"
- "How soon do you need this?"

## 💬 WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IN ACTION

**BAD (Feature Dump):**

Customer: "I'm looking for running shoes."
You: "Great! This one has React foam, this one has Zoom Air, this one is the new model with carbon fiber plate for speed, this one breathes better, this one—"

Customer: 😵‍💫 "Let me think about it."

---

**GOOD (70/30 Rule):**

Customer: "I'm looking for running shoes."

You: "Nice—what kind of running do you do?" **[Question 1: Occasion]**

Customer: "Just getting started, really. Trying to lose some weight."

You: "That's awesome. What made you decide to start?" **[Building rapport]**

Customer: "Doctor said I need to get active. My knees aren't great."

You: "Got it. So comfort and support are probably more important than speed right now?" **[Question 3: Priority]**

Customer: "Yeah, exactly."

You: "Perfect. And have you tried running shoes before, or is this your first pair?" **[Question 2: Problem]**

Customer: "Had some cheap ones that hurt after 20 minutes."

You: "Okay, so we need something with good cushioning that won't hurt your knees. Let me show you two options that would work really well for you."

**Now you can recommend.** And when you do, you connect features to their specific needs:

"This one [hold up shoe] has extra cushioning here and here, which will absorb impact and help with your knees. Most people who are just starting running love this one because it's comfortable from day one—no break-in period."

## 🎭 REAL EXAMPLE: Luxury Retail

High-end retail staff were described as asking:

- What kind of beach? (Relaxed resort or beach club?)
- What activities? (Swimming? Lounging? Party?)
- What's your style usually? (Covered up or showing skin?)
- What do you usually struggle with? (Finding the right fit? Looking put-together?)

By the time they show the first item, they know **exactly why they're showing it.**

"Based on what you told me—that you're going to a beach club and want to look put-together but not overdressed—I think this would be perfect because..."

That's not selling. That's **solving.**

---

## 🚧 COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Asking questions but not listening to answers**
You ask "What kind of running?" but you're already thinking about which shoe to show. Stop. Actually listen.

**Mistake 2: Asking too many questions at once**
One question at a time. Let them answer. Then ask a follow-up based on what they said.

**Mistake 3: Jumping to recommendations too fast**
If you're showing products after 30 seconds of conversation, you probably don't understand what they need yet. Slow down.

**Mistake 4: Feeling like you need to know everything**
It's okay to say "That's a great question—let me find out for you." Better than making something up.

## 🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY

**Pick 3 customers today and go deep with the 4 Questions Framework.**

For each customer:
1. ✅ Ask about the **Occasion** (what are they buying for?)
2. ✅ Ask about the **Problem** (what's not working now?)
3. ✅ Ask about the **Priority** (what matters most?)
4. ✅ Ask about the **Decision Context** (buying today or researching?)

**Only after you've asked all 4** should you start showing products.

**End of day:** Write down what you learned. Did asking more questions help you recommend better? Did customers seem more engaged?

---

## 📊 MEASURING SUCCESS

By the end of this week, you should:
- ✅ Be asking at least **2 questions** before showing any product
- ✅ Have customers talking **more than you** in conversations
- ✅ Hear customers say things like "exactly!" or "yes, that's what I need" (sign you understood them)
- ✅ Feel more confident in your recommendations (because you know why you're suggesting what you're suggesting)

---

## 🧠 WHY THIS WORKS

**Product knowledge is important—but only after you understand the customer's need.**

A customer doesn't care about React foam. They care about their knees not hurting.

A customer doesn't care about thread count. They care about sheets feeling softer than what they have now.

A customer doesn't care about the new colorway. They care about looking good at their cousin's wedding.

**When you ask questions first, you can connect features to needs.** That's when features matter.

One manager said it perfectly:

> "If you give me a trained lady who can sell, she can sell anything. But if you give me someone who just knows the product inside out but doesn't know the routine? They'll feature dump and the customer will leave."

**Routine beats knowledge.**

---

## 🔥 ADVANCED TIP: The Summary Statement

After they've answered your questions, **summarize what you heard** before recommending:

"So if I'm understanding you right—you're running 3 times a week, your knees have been bothering you, and comfort is the top priority. Does that sound right?"

**Why this works:**
1. Shows you were actually listening
2. Confirms you understood correctly
3. Builds trust fast
4. Makes them more receptive to your recommendation

## ➡️ TOMORROW: Mission 4 — "I'll Think About It"

You're engaging customers well. You're asking great questions. You're showing them exactly what they need.

And then they say: **"Let me think about it."**

Tomorrow we'll cover how to handle that objection—and why it's actually an opportunity, not a rejection.

See you tomorrow.

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE: The 4 Questions Framework

(Save this - you'll use it in your practice today)

1. **OCCASION** - "What are you buying for?"
2. **PROBLEM** - "What's not working with what you have now?"
3. **PRIORITY** - "What matters most—comfort, durability, or style?"
4. **DECISION CONTEXT** - "Are you hoping to leave with something today?"

**Only show products after you've asked all 4.**

---

**💡 Quick Tip:** If a customer seems hesitant to answer questions, they might feel interrogated. Soften it: "Just trying to make sure I show you the right stuff—what kind of [X] are you usually into?"
