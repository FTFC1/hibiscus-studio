## Mission 1 Quiz: The 5-30-60 Rule

**Instructions:** Answer 5 questions about the 5-30-60 Rule. You need 4 correct to pass and unlock Mission 2.

---

### Question 1: Concept Check
**The 5-30-60 Rule states that customers decide whether to engage with you within:**

- **A)** 5 seconds of seeing you, 30 seconds of conversation, 60 seconds of browsing
- **B)** 5 seconds of entering, 30 seconds of approach, 60 seconds of demo
- **C)** 5 minutes of arrival, 30 minutes of browsing, 60 minutes total
- **D)** 5 eye contacts, 30 steps away, 60% of the time

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The rule is 5 seconds (when customer enters store), 30 seconds (when you approach), 60 seconds (when demoing/showing product). These are the critical decision windows.

---

### Question 2: Scenario Application
**A customer walks into your PUMA store. You're folding shirts 8 meters away. What should you do in the first 5 seconds?**

- **A)** Finish folding the shirt, then approach
- **B)** Make eye contact and smile/nod, then continue your task
- **C)** Immediately walk over and say "Can I help you?"
- **D)** Wait to see what section they go to first

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In the first 5 seconds, acknowledge their presence (eye contact + smile/nod) but don't approach yet. This shows you see them without pressure. Immediate approach triggers "just browsing" defense.

---

### Question 3: True/False Understanding
**True or False: You should approach customers within 30 seconds of them entering the store to maximize sales.**

- **A)** True - faster approach = more sales
- **B)** False - you should wait at least 2 minutes
- **C)** True - but only if they look lost
- **D)** False - 30 seconds is the window to DECIDE to approach, not necessarily approach immediately

**Correct Answer:** D
**Explanation:** The 30-second rule means you have 30 seconds to read the customer and decide your approach strategy. If they're purposeful, give space. If they're browsing slowly, approach. Don't auto-approach everyone at 30 seconds.

---

### Question 4: Cost Calculation
**According to the mission, how many lost sales per day from poor timing costs ₦15.6M annually?**

- **A)** 5 lost sales/day
- **B)** 10 lost sales/day
- **C)** 2 lost sales/day
- **D)** 1 lost sale/day

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** 2 lost sales/day × 6 days/week = 12 lost sales/week × ₦25K average = ₦300K/week × 52 weeks = ₦15.6M/year. Small daily failures compound to massive annual losses.

---

### Question 5: Practical Application
**Customer enters, makes eye contact with you, then walks to the running shoe wall and picks up a shoe to examine. This is your signal to:**

- **A)** Approach immediately - they picked up a shoe (buying signal)
- **B)** Wait another 30 seconds - they need more space
- **C)** Approach now with an open question about what they're looking for
- **D)** Call out from across the floor: "That's a great shoe!"

**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** Picking up a product = engagement signal. They've moved past browsing mode. Approach now with a question ("What kind of running do you do?") not a statement. This is your 30-second window to engage.

---

## Mission 2 Quiz: Kill "Can I Help You?"

**Instructions:** Answer 5 questions about warm openings. You need 4 correct to pass and unlock Mission 3.

---

### Question 1: Concept Check
**Why does "Can I help you?" kill sales?**

- **A)** It's too polite and formal
- **B)** It's a yes/no question that invites "No" as the easiest answer
- **C)** Customers don't know what they need help with
- **D)** It makes you sound like a security guard

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "Can I help you?" is a closed question. The path of least resistance is "No, just browsing." This ends the conversation before it starts. Warm openings are open questions that require real answers.

---

### Question 2: Script Recall
**Which of these is Opening #1 from the mission?**

- **A)** "Can I help you find something?"
- **B)** "What brings you in today?"
- **C)** "Are you looking for anything specific?"
- **D)** "Welcome to PUMA! Let me know if you need anything."

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Opening #1 is "What brings you in today?" - an open question that reveals their need state. The customer has to give a real answer (running shoes, gift, replacement, etc.)

---

### Question 3: Scenario Application
**Customer is examining track pants. You approach and say: "Looking for something for the gym?" Customer responds: "Yeah, something comfortable." What do you do next?**

- **A)** Say "These are comfortable" and wait
- **B)** Ask: "What kind of workouts do you usually do?"
- **C)** Show them 3 different pants immediately
- **D)** Say "Try these on and let me know if you need a different size"

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** They gave you a one-word answer ("comfortable"). Dig deeper with a follow-up question about their workout type. This reveals whether they need breathable (cardio), stretchy (yoga), durable (outdoor), etc. More questions = better recommendations.

---

### Question 4: Objection Recovery
**Customer says "Just browsing." You should:**

- **A)** Say "No problem, let me know if you need anything" and walk away
- **B)** Say "That's cool! If you see anything you want to try on, I'm here"
- **C)** Push harder: "What specifically are you browsing for?"
- **D)** Ignore the brush-off and keep talking about products

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** When they say "just browsing," acknowledge it, give them space, but leave the door open with a specific offer ("try on"). Don't disappear completely - stay visible and available. Option A is too passive (you vanish), Option C is too pushy (ignores their boundary).

---

### Question 5: Multiple Opening Selection
**Customer speed-walking toward shoe section, scanning shelves. Best opening?**

- **A)** "What brings you in today?" (Opening #1)
- **B)** "What are you hoping to find?" (Opening #2 - need-focused)
- **C)** "I love those! What caught your eye?" (Opening #3 - item-specific)
- **D)** "Welcome! Let me know if you need help."

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Customer has purpose (speed-walking) and is scanning (looking for something specific). Opening #2 ("What are you hoping to find?") matches their urgency. Opening #1 works too, but #2 is more direct for high-intent customers.

---

## Mission 3 Quiz: The 70/30 Rule

**Instructions:** Answer 5 questions about listening vs. talking. You need 4 correct to pass and unlock Mission 4.

---

### Question 1: Concept Check
**The 70/30 Rule states that during the browsing phase:**

- **A)** You should talk 70% of the time to share product knowledge
- **B)** Customer should talk 70% of the time while you listen
- **C)** 70% of customers will buy if you let them browse 30 minutes
- **D)** Spend 70% of time showing products, 30% answering questions

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** In the browsing/discovery phase, the customer should be talking 70% of the time, you 30%. Your job is to ask questions and listen, not to feature-dump. Understanding their needs comes before showcasing products.

---

### Question 2: The 4 Questions Framework - Order
**Which question should you ask FIRST in the 4 Questions Framework?**

- **A)** "What matters most—comfort, durability, or style?" (Priority)
- **B)** "What are you buying for?" (Occasion)
- **C)** "What's not working with what you have now?" (Problem)
- **D)** "Are you hoping to leave with something today?" (Decision Context)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Start with Occasion ("What are you buying for?") - this gives you context. Then Problem (what's not working), then Priority (what matters most), then Decision Context (buying today?). The order matters - each question builds on the previous answer.

---

### Question 3: Scenario Recognition
**Customer: "I need running shoes." You show 5 models and explain React foam, Zoom Air, carbon fiber plates, breathability, and colorways. Customer says "Let me think about it" and leaves. What went wrong?**

- **A)** You showed too many options (should be 2-3 max)
- **B)** You feature-dumped without understanding their actual need
- **C)** The customer wasn't serious about buying
- **D)** You needed to mention the price sooner

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Classic feature dump. You talked about product features (React foam, etc.) without asking WHY they need running shoes. Maybe their knees hurt (need cushioning) or they're training for a race (need speed) or they're beginners (need comfort). You don't know because you didn't ask the 4 Questions first.

---

### Question 4: Practical Application
**Customer: "I'm looking for track pants." You ask: "What are you buying for?" Customer: "Working out at home, mostly yoga and stretching." What should you ask next?**

- **A)** "What size do you usually wear?" (move to product)
- **B)** "What's not working with your current workout pants?" (Problem question)
- **C)** "Do you want fitted or loose?" (product detail)
- **D)** "We have these on sale, want to see?" (push to sale)

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** After Occasion, ask Problem. "What's not working?" might reveal: "They ride up during downward dog" or "They're too hot" or "They don't have pockets." Now you know which features to emphasize. Don't jump to product details (size, fit) until you understand their frustration with current gear.

---

### Question 5: The Summary Statement Technique
**After a customer answers your 4 questions, you should:**

- **A)** Immediately show them 3 products that match
- **B)** Summarize what you heard and confirm you understood correctly
- **C)** Ask them what their budget is
- **D)** Tell them about your favorite product in that category

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** Use the Summary Statement: "So if I'm understanding you right—you're running 3x/week, your knees hurt, and comfort is top priority. Is that right?" This proves you listened, confirms understanding, and builds trust. THEN recommend products. Customers are more receptive when they feel heard.

- Adjust pass threshold to 3/4 correct (75%)

**If Selar doesn't support question randomization:**
- Manually create 2 versions of each quiz (A/B versions)

---

## Staff Experience Flow

**In Selar:**
1. Staff completes mission (reads 800-1,200 word lesson)
2. Clicks "Take Quiz" button at bottom
3. Answers 5 questions
4. Sees immediate feedback per question
5. Gets final score (e.g., "You scored 4/5 - Passed!")
6. Mission 2 unlocks automatically
7. If failed: Reviews explanations, retakes immediately

**In Telegram:**
- Manager posts: "🎉 3 people passed Mission 1 quiz today! Who's next?"
- Staff celebrate each other's progress
- Peer accountability ("I'm on Mission 3, where are you?")

---

## Alternative: Paper-Based Quiz (Backup Plan)

**If Selar quiz feature fails:**
1. Print quiz (one per staff member)
2. Staff take quiz on paper after reading mission
3. Manager grades using answer key (2 minutes/quiz)
4. Manager uploads completed quiz photo to Selar as "Mission 1 completion proof"
5. Staff proceeds to next mission

**Trade-off:**
- More manager time (5-10 mins grading vs. auto-grading)
- Less immediate feedback (wait for manager vs. instant)
- Still proves comprehension (not honor system)

## Quiz Performance Signals for Case Study

**Track these metrics in admin dashboard:**
- Average score per quiz (should be 80-90% after retakes)
- Average attempts to pass (ideal: 1-2 attempts, red flag: 4+ attempts)
- Time spent per quiz (ideal: 5-10 minutes)
- Questions with highest failure rate (signals content needs revision)

**Red flags:**
- Mission 1 quiz: 50% failure rate → Content too complex, simplify
- Mission 3 quiz: Everyone passes first try → Questions too easy, increase rigor
- Staff taking 30+ minutes on quiz → Confused about concept, need clearer examples

**Green flags:**
- 80-90% pass rate after 1-2 attempts → Content calibrated correctly
- 10-15 minutes total time (read + quiz) → Efficient learning
- Practical task scores improve after quiz → Knowledge transfer working

---

**Ready for Selar upload:** These quizzes can be copied directly into Selar's quiz builder (one question per block, 4 answer choices each).

**Next step:** Write Missions 4-6 to complete Module 1 pilot content.
