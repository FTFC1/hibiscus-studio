# Mission 1: The 5-30-60 Rule

**⏱️ Time:** 5-7 minutes
**🎯 What you'll learn:** How to acknowledge and approach customers in a way that feels welcoming, not aggressive

---

## ⚠️ THE PROBLEM

Customer walks into your store. You're busy restocking shoes. Or chatting with a colleague. Or on your phone for just a second.

By the time you look up, the customer is already browsing alone. They pick up a shoe, look at the price, put it back. They wander around for 3-4 minutes. Then they leave.

You didn't even get a chance to help them.

This happens **all day, every day** in retail stores. And it's killing your sales before they even start.

---

## 💰 WHY THIS COSTS YOU SALES

Here's what a manager at a major sportswear store told us:

> "A lot of times we have staff on the shop floor that's actually not serving customers. They're physically present, but not engaging."

When customers browse alone for too long, three things happen:

**1. They make up their own mind** — and usually decide against buying. Without you there to answer questions, handle concerns, or show alternatives, they're left guessing. Most people guess "no."

**2. They feel ignored** — which makes them uncomfortable. If your store feels like an interruption to your staff's real work, why would they come back?

**3. You lose the sale entirely** — The average customer decides whether to buy within the first 3-5 minutes of browsing. If you're not engaged during that window, you're hoping they sell themselves. They usually don't.

**Real cost calculation:**
- 2 lost sales/day × 6 days/week = **12 lost sales/week**
- 12 lost sales × ₦25,000 average basket = **₦300,000/week**
- ₦300,000/week × 52 weeks = **₦15.6 million/year**

Just from customers who weren't greeted properly.

## ✅ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

### The 5-30-60 Rule

This is your new standard for every customer who walks through the door:

**⚡ 5 seconds: ACKNOWLEDGE**
- Make eye contact
- Smile
- Nod slightly

That's it. Don't rush over yet. Don't say anything yet. Just show them: "I see you. You're welcome here."

Even if you're helping another customer, acknowledge the new arrival: "I'll be right with you!"

**👋 30 seconds: APPROACH (if they're browsing openly)**
- If they're looking around, touching products, clearly browsing → approach
- If they're walking with purpose to a specific spot → give them 10 more seconds

**🎯 60 seconds: APPROACH (no matter what)**
- Everyone gets engaged within 60 seconds
- No customer should browse alone for more than a minute

## 💬 WHAT TO SAY

Here's what **doesn't work:**
- "Can I help you?" → Gets "No, just looking" 90% of the time
- Standing silently next to them → Feels creepy, not helpful
- Aggressive immediate approach → Makes them feel hunted

Here's what **does work:**

**Option 1: The Warm Welcome**
"Hey! Welcome. I'm [Your Name]. What brings you in today?"

**Option 2: The Compliment Bridge**
"I love those shoes you're wearing—are you looking for something similar or something different?"

**Option 3: The Occasion Opener**
"Are you shopping for yourself or looking for a gift?"

**Option 4: The Product Hook**
(If they're looking at something specific)
"That's one of our most popular items—the [specific feature] is what people love about it. Trying it on?"

Notice: These are **open questions** or **statements** that invite conversation. They're not yes/no questions that get shut down.

## 🎭 REAL EXAMPLE

Here's how a luxury retail manager described handling a high-profile customer:

> "I did my research before they came in—knew what they had going on. When they walked in, I didn't treat them like 'I want your money.' I acknowledged them, let them settle, then started a conversation about their upcoming event."

**Result:** They bought multiple outfits.

**The lesson:** She didn't pounce. She acknowledged (5 seconds), gave space (30 seconds), then re-engaged with context (60 seconds). Even with regular customers, this works.

---

## 🚧 WHAT IF THEY SAY "JUST LOOKING"?

Don't disappear. Say this:

**"No problem at all—I'll be right over here. My name's [X]. Come find me when you're ready or if you have any questions."**

Then **stay visible.** Don't vanish to the back room or your phone.

Check back in 3-4 minutes:
"How are you doing? Found anything you like?"

Most "just looking" customers will warm up after they've browsed alone for a few minutes. Give them space, but stay available.

## 🎯 YOUR PRACTICE TODAY

**Today on the floor:**

1. **Count to 5** every time a customer walks in. Make eye contact and smile before you reach 5.

2. **Set a 60-second timer in your head.** If you haven't approached by then, approach immediately.

3. **Kill "Can I help you?" from your vocabulary.** Try these instead:
   - "What brings you in today?"
   - "Are you looking for something specific or just seeing what's new?"
   - "I saw you looking at [item]—that one's really popular. Want to try it on?"

4. **End of day:** Count how many customers you greeted within 30 seconds. Write it down. Tomorrow, try to beat that number.

---

## 📊 MEASURING SUCCESS

By the end of this week, you should:
- ✅ Acknowledge **every** customer within 5 seconds
- ✅ Approach **80%+** of customers within 60 seconds
- ✅ Hear "just looking" **less than 50%** of the time (because you're asking better questions)

If you're still hearing "just looking" constantly, you're probably asking "Can I help you?" Stop. Use the warm openers above.

## 🧠 WHY THIS WORKS

Customers aren't avoiding you because they're rude or antisocial. They're avoiding you because:
- They don't want to feel pressured
- They don't want to waste your time if they're "just browsing"
- They've had bad experiences with pushy salespeople before

The 5-30-60 Rule respects their space while showing you're **available, not aggressive.**

It signals: "I'm here to help when you're ready, not to force you to buy."

And that makes them **way more likely** to engage with you.

## ➡️ TOMORROW: Mission 2 — Kill "Can I Help You?"

We'll dive deeper into the exact words to use when you approach customers. You'll learn 5 warm openings that actually work (and why "Can I help you?" is sabotaging your sales).

**💡 Quick Tip:** If you're with another customer when someone new walks in, **acknowledge them immediately** even if you can't approach yet. "I'll be right with you!" buys you time and shows them they matter.
