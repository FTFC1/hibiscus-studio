## What We're Working On

**Primary Goal:** Design practice mechanic for cross-selling/upselling training

**Context from Yesterday:**
- Product list ingested (many products)
- Course Module 1 complete, Selar Pro active
- Need to figure out: How do staff **truly learn** cross-selling/upselling?

**Today's Focus:**
1. Design practice mechanic
2. Build multi-role presentation (salesperson, manager, stakeholder views)
3. Show Adedolapo + team → invoice

## Session Activity Log

### Setup & Context Review
- Moved HUD from `00_Inbox/jan 29/` to permanent location: `projects/hud/index.html`
- Updated HUD: Jan 30, live clock, removed redundant working indicator
- Clarified task sequences across all projects

### Parallel Work Model
**Reality check:** Not single focus - 3 streams happening simultaneously:
1. **STREAM 1:** PUMA training games (polish + hosting)
2. **STREAM 2:** Portfolio build (user decisions needed)
3. **STREAM 3:** Mikano Gen old Cummins (waiting for price quote)

### Current Question
**How do staff practice cross-selling/upselling in a way that creates real learning?**

Options to explore:
- Role-play scenarios with feedback
- Product pair flashcards
- Customer scenario simulations
- Manager-led practice sessions
- Telegram-based challenges

## Session Packet Strategy (Meta)

**Question raised:** If continuing work from yesterday to today, do we make a new session packet for today but link to the old one?

**Answer:** Yes. New day = new session packet, with link to previous day's packet for continuity.

**Rationale:**
- Each day's context is separate
- Links preserve thread
- Easier to ingest daily packets vs. one growing file
- Pattern: `2026-01-30-topic.md` → references `2026-01-29-topic.md` at top
