# Session Packet: Partner Brief EP Analysis & Redesign

**Session Date:** 2026-02-03
**Project:** Generator Sales (GAS)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** ~3h
**Work Type:** Implementation + Strategy

---

## Summary

Applied EP AI Frontrunners frameworks to Mikano partner brief strategy. Redesigned brief from text-heavy to visual (SVG icons, cards, timeline). Analyzed MEP transcript to extract Nigerian B2B generator market realities. Created comprehensive context profile. Updated brief positioning from "Schedule Call" CTA to "Avoid Undersizing - Request Site Assessment" (risk mitigation > price discount).

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. **Target Persona Reordering**
- **Before:** Architects, Developers, MEP Professionals
- **After:** Project Managers, Architects, Consultants
- **Rationale:** MEP transcript confirmed PMs have highest influence ("closer relationship with client than consultant"). PMs sometimes ARE architects/developers (role overlap).

### 2. **CTA Pivot: Risk Mitigation Over Conversion**
- **Before:** "Schedule Intro Call" (high friction)
- **After:** "Avoid Undersizing Disasters - Request Site Assessment" (low friction, risk mitigation)
- **Rationale:** Low-trust society (Nigeria) = Risk avoidance > Price savings. Load creep = PM/Consultant's nightmare scenario.

### 3. **Load Creep Positioning**
- **Added:** "Load Creep Protection" card in "What We Provide" section
- **Icon:** Warning triangle (risk mitigation visual)
- **Copy:** "We factor in equipment additions and load changes to prevent undersizing disasters that cost you later."
- **Rationale:** MEP described load creep disaster (client buys 250kVA early, load increases to 300kVA, stuck with wrong size). This is THE pain point for PMs/Consultants.

### 4. **Instagram Channel = Skip**
- **Decision:** Remove Instagram from HUD open items
- **Rationale:** EP analysis + MEP transcript confirmed:
  - Target market = "old folks" (not on social media for generator decisions)
  - EP Instagram strategy = B2C cold traffic (doesn't fit B2B Nigerian context)
  - One post won't validate (need account setup, 3+ posts/week, 2-3 months)
  - Time investment: 10-15 hours for uncertain ROI
  - **Fisayo model (warm referrals) already validated** (7 referrals, 2-min call)

### 5. **Gas vs Diesel Strategic Question**
- **Gas Positioning:** Uphill battle ("Nobody pitching gas to clients", slow adoption, solar competition)
- **Gas Success Case:** Industrial 24/7 (Visul Telecoms - 3,000 masts, diesel → gas)
- **Diesel Positioning:** Easier market (mature, no adoption barrier) but more competition (JMG, Mantrac/Caterpillar)
- **Decision:** Lead with diesel (<1MW) for easier conversions. Gas (1MW-2.5MW) = secondary offer for industrial clients.
- **Blocker:** Mikano internal constraints (company won't fund billboards, no network access, sales team protective).

     - Decision drivers (referrals > merit, risk mitigation > price, load creep nightmare)
     - Barriers (gas adoption, low-trust society, Mikano constraints, solar competition)
     - Validated insights (Fisayo model, load creep opportunity, PM influence)
   - **Purpose:** Reference for all GAS strategy decisions going forward

## EP Frameworks Applied

### M2L6 - Ecosystem Thinking
**Insight:** Fisayo → 7 referrals → Case study → Network density (2nd/3rd order effects).
**Not:** Linear referrals (Fisayo → Person 1 → Person 2).
**Is:** Network density (Fisayo's network starts referring each other).

### M2L7 - Solution Formats
**Insight:** Partner brief = Education (teach Fisayo how to refer). Generator sales = Implementation (done-for-you).
**Validation:** Correct for relationship-driven Nigerian market (they want "you do it for me" not "teach me to size generators").

### M3L6 - Niching Down
**Insight:** Niche by WHO (Project Managers with active pipelines), not WHAT (generator sales).
**Validation:** Fisayo works because he has ongoing project pipeline (10-20 projects/year), not because he's an architect.

### M3L7 - Authority & Positioning
**Insight:** Positioning = What referrers say about you. Fisayo's endorsement > Mikano's self-promotion.
**Challenge:** Build YOUR positioning (referral engine operator), not just Mikano's (30-year brand).

### M4L1 - Copywriting (Risk Mitigation)
**Insight:** Low-trust society (Nigeria) = Risk mitigation > Price savings.
**What sells:** "Avoid undersizing", "30 years credibility", "Generator financing available".
**What doesn't:** "Preferential pricing" (cheaper = suspicious in low-trust market).

### M6 - Distribution
**Insight:** Warm referrals (Fisayo model) = proven. Cold Instagram (B2C strategy) = doesn't fit B2B Nigerian context.
**Validation:** MEP said "Target market = old folks" (not on social media for generator decisions).

## MEP Transcript Key Insights

### Decision Hierarchy Confirmed
- **PM > Consultant > Architect > MEP Contractor > Procurement**
- MEP quote: "Project manager has closer relationship and better understanding with client than consultant."
- PM sometimes IS architect/developer (role overlap).

### Referrals Dominate
- MEP quote: "Many things are done by referral. Nobody has time to read up about generators. 'This generator is good' → 'Okay let me buy it.'"
- No due diligence, trust-based decisions.

### Load Creep = Nightmare Scenario
- Client adds equipment during project (designer lights, bigger ACs, pool pumps).
- Load goes 200kVA → 230kVA.
- Client already bought 250kVA gen early (inflation hedge).
- Now stuck with undersized gen → Constant repairs → Eventually buy new gen.
- **Consultant/PM gets blamed** (reputation risk).

### Low-Trust Society Proof
- MEP quote: "Some clients will say: 'It's a million naira cheaper, but I know this brand. I'd rather spend more now than less later.'"
- Price discount alone doesn't convince.
- Brand credibility (30 years) + Risk mitigation > Price savings.

### Gas Adoption Barriers
- MEP quote: "Nobody is pitching gas to clients. Nigeria is very slow adopting new systems."
- Causes: Bad LPG PR (car explosions), solar competition ("spend once, don't buy gas regularly").
- **Exception:** Industrial 24/7 (Visul Telecoms - 3,000 masts, diesel → gas, cost savings, life extension).

### Solar = Main Competitor
- MEP quote: "Solar system is actually killing diesel/gas/petrol generators."
- Client preference: One-time solar cost > Recurring diesel/gas fuel.
- Hybrid trend: Solar first → Add more solar (not diesel backup).

### Outdoor Marketing Insight
- MEP quote: "It has to be in their faces. Billboards - they drive fast, see something catchy, then call to ask."
- Creates awareness → Leads to referral asks ("I saw Mikano gas, is it good?").
- **Blocker:** Company won't fund billboards (Mikano internal constraint).

## Open Items

### Week 1 Execution (from HUD)
1. **Fisayo's 7 referrals** - Call/meet this week, qualify projects (use 6-question script), convert 2+
2. **Fill contact info in partner brief** - Add name, WhatsApp, email, then send to Fisayo
3. **Create referral PDF** - ₦500K-₦1M commission, priority pricing, technical support (after first deal?)

### Research Needed
1. **Competitor analysis** - JMG, Mantrac/Caterpillar, others (pricing, delivery times, positioning)
2. **Project Manager companies** - MEP said "there are a lot, just not pronounced" (how to find them?)
3. **Industrial clients** - Telecom, manufacturing with 24/7 operations (how to reach decision makers?)

### Strategic Questions
1. **Gas vs Diesel focus?** - Lead with diesel (<1MW, easier market) or gas (1-2.5MW, proven for industrial)?
2. **How to replicate Fisayo 10x?** - Fisayo = family relationship. How to find non-family architects/PMs with trust?
3. **Outdoor marketing ROI?** - Billboards create awareness, but company won't fund. Worth pursuing?

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Instagram Assumption
- **Challenge:** HUD showed Instagram content planned (3 posts this week).
- **Reality Check:** EP analysis + MEP transcript proved Instagram won't work (target = old folks, B2C strategy doesn't fit B2B).
- **Resolution:** Removed from HUD, confirmed referral focus.

### 2. Gas Positioning Difficulty
- **Challenge:** MTU gas generators (1-2.5MW) = lead product in brief.
- **Reality Check:** MEP said "Nobody pitching gas", slow adoption, solar winning.
- **Resolution:** Keep gas in brief (proven for industrial 24/7), but lead sales conversations with diesel (<1MW easier market).

### 3. Context Profile Scope
- **Challenge:** Initial context profile missed company info, industries, ICP, tested channels breakdown.
- **Resolution:** Created comprehensive JSON with all fields (company, market, hierarchy, industries, products, ICP, tested channels, barriers, insights).

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate
1. ✅ **Partner brief updated** - Visual design, Load Creep card, CTA pivot
2. ✅ **Context profile created** - Comprehensive JSON reference
3. ✅ **Artifact index updated** - 2 new artifacts added
4. ⏸️ **Fill contact info** - Add name, WhatsApp, email to partner brief
5. ⏸️ **Update HUD** - Remove Instagram from open items, confirm referral focus

### Week 1 (from HUD)
1. **Follow up Fisayo's 7 referrals** - Qualify with 6-question script, convert 2+
2. **Create case study** - After first deal closes (proof it works for network density)
3. **Ask Fisayo for second-order referrals** - "Who else in your network has projects?"

### Strategic Research
1. **Competitor positioning** - JMG, Mantrac, others (what do they emphasize? Speed? Price? Quality?)
2. **PM company list** - LinkedIn research, industry associations, construction forums
3. **Industrial case studies** - Telecom, manufacturing success stories (gas conversions, cost savings)

---

## Learnings

### 1. **EP Skill = Force Multiplier**
- Without EP analysis, would have:
  - Kept Instagram in strategy (waste 10-15 hours)
  - Led with "Schedule Call" CTA (high friction, low conversion)
  - Missed load creep positioning (THE differentiator for PMs/Consultants)
- EP frameworks surfaced non-obvious insights from MEP transcript (risk mitigation > price, PM > MEP, referrals > merit).

### 2. **MEP Transcript = Gold**
- Real operator insights > Marketing materials.
- Validated: Referrals dominate, low-trust society, load creep nightmare, gas adoption slow.
- Corrected: Instagram won't work, procurement = low influence, PM = highest influence.

### 3. **Context Profile = Strategic Asset**
- Comprehensive JSON captures Nigerian market realities.
- Reference for all GAS decisions (prevents drift, maintains alignment).
- Includes tested channels (not "failed" - shows outcomes, learnings, recommendations).

### 4. **Visual Brief = Architect-Friendly**
- Text-heavy brief = 8-10 min read time.
- Visual brief (icons, cards, timeline) = 2-3 min scan time.
- EP copywriting principle: "Architects scan, not read."

### 5. **Risk Mitigation > Price Discount**
- Low-trust society (Nigeria) = Brand credibility matters more than savings.
- Load creep = PM/Consultant's reputation risk (they get blamed if generator fails).
- CTA pivot: "Avoid Undersizing" > "Schedule Call" (speaks to their pain, not your process).
