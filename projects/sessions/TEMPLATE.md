**Session Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** {emoji} {status text}
**Duration:** ~Xh Ym

## THE BIGGER GOAL

{What system/capability are we building? Not just the task, but the compound effect.}

### What We're Building
{1-3 sentences on the system vision}

### The Vision
```
{ASCII diagram showing the loop or flow}
```

### The North Star
> "{Quote format: the end state we're working toward}"

---

## Context

{Link to parent session if continuation. Brief setup of why this session happened.}

---

## What Changed

{Key decisions made, pivots, scope changes. Each decision should have rationale.}

### Decision: {Name}
**Choice:** {what was decided}
**Why:** {rationale}
**Supersedes:** {previous decision if applicable}

---

## Work Completed

{Deliverables, deployed items, artifacts created.}

| Artifact | Location | Type | Status |
|----------|----------|------|--------|
| {name} | {path} | {md/html/js} | {delivered/internal} |

---

## Open Items

{Next actions, blockers, waiting on external.}

### Blockers
- [ ] {who}: {what} (since YYYY-MM-DD)

### Next Actions
- [ ] {action item}

---

## Cross-Project Impact

{Ripple effects to other projects. What changed elsewhere because of this session.}

| Project | Impact | Action Needed |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| {tag} | {what changed} | {who does what} |

---

## Key Learnings

{Insights worth remembering. Quotes from user. Strategic observations.}

---

## TEMPLATE PATTERNS (From Real Captures)

{If this session involved extracting patterns from voice notes or messages, document them here.}

### Template 1: Business Rules
```
FOR [event type/entity]:
  → Rule: [what happens]
  → Rationale: "[why - from experience]"
  → Warning: "[what happens if ignored]"
```

### Template 2: Time Breakdowns
```
[ACTIVITY] BREAKDOWN ([total time])

Activity                     Time
─────────────────────────────────────
[Phase 1]................... Xh Ym
[Phase 2]................... Xh Ym
─────────────────────────────────────
Total                        Xh Ym
```

### Template 3: Decision Rationale
```
DECISION: [what we do]
BECAUSE: [reasoning]
EVIDENCE: [what I've seen happen]
```

### Template 4: Entity Disambiguation
```
⚠️ [ENTITY A] ≠ [ENTITY B]

| Dimension | Entity A | Entity B |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Type      | ...      | ...      |
| Lead      | ...      | ...      |

RULE: When [trigger], it means [Entity X], not [Entity Y]
```
