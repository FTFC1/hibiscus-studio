**Subject:** Request for Call Centre Phone - Mikano Motors (Under N40k)

**Body:**
```
Good Afternoon Abdallah,

I'm writing to request a phone for the Mikano Motors Call Centre team.

Current Situation:
The call centre currently has a CUG (Closed User Group) line but no physical device to utilise it.

Business Need:
A basic phone is needed for calling back customers to ensure timely follow-ups and customer satisfaction.
This aligns with the setup for the Power Call Centre staff, who have a similar phone for operational support.

Request:
One basic phone (budget: under N40,000). I've identified two cost-effective options:
itel 2160 Dual SIM Wireless FM - ₦14,800
Nokia 210 Dual SIM - ₦27,000

Both options are durable, well within budget, and suitable for our call-back requirements.

Please let me know if you need any additional information to approve this request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
FT Coker
```

| **Battery Life** | Standard | 20 days | Nokia 210 |
| **Brand Reliability** | Moderate | High | Nokia 210 |
| **Features** | Basic | Basic+ | Nokia 210 |
| **Value for Money** | Excellent | Good | itel 2160 |

**Recommendation:** Either option works, but:
