# Session Packet: Training Images Integration

**Session Date:** 2026-01-30
**Project:** PUMA Retail Training (Aloe Labs)
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

## Context

Adding product images to PUMA training course to make it more visual and sell better. Using placeholder approach - structured image areas ready for real PUMA product photos.

## Strategic Placement

**1. index.html (Navigation Page)**
- Hero product image below quote (visual brand reinforcement)

**2. lesson-customer-types.html (Content Lesson)**
- Product images next to each of 5 customer types
- Shows what each customer type would buy

**3. puma-basket-game-v2.html (Interactive Game)**
- Product cards with images in selection interface
- Visual game, not just text buttons
