## CONV OPS PLATFORM (emerged Feb 12 — 4 rounds of /recursive)

```
PATTERN: "I'll send you a bot" replaces forms, calls, PDFs, meetings
5 ENGINES: Assess | Practice | Deliver | Channel | Intelligence
EDGE: Voice + media inputs (voice notes, photos, screen recordings)

VERTICALS (scored):
  Business Ops Bot (Flower Girl)  9.7  ★★★ BUILD NEXT (dog-food)
  Client Intake (Aloe Labs)       9.3  ★★★ LATER
  Lead Qualification (DSG)        8.8  ★★  LATER
  Product Knowledge (PRL)         8.7  ★   DURING TRIAL
  Onboarding                      8.5  ★   UPSELL

NAMING: Context-dependent (retail→"training", workshop→"business ops")
EP: Hybrid pricing. Case study flywheel. Phase 1→2→3. Agents > hires.
CHECKPOINT: session-packets/2026-02-12-conv-ops-platform-checkpoint.md
```

## RAISED ITEMS (3/5 cap)

```
- seed   Stream maintenance check — 1 week test on /stream overhead
- shaped Content visualization pipeline — systems → explainer images → content
- seed   /capture vs /process-convo clarity — different triggers, different outputs
```

## ANTI-CHECKLIST (always apply)

- **INTERNAL SOURCES FIRST** — project.json → internal files → THEN web search
- **NODE > DIRECT** — Referral networks = 5-10x pipeline multiplier
- **ACTION > ACKNOWLEDGEMENT** — "Noted" = failure. Build it or explain why not.
- **ECOSYSTEM > LINEAR** — Same effort, compounding output across projects
- **SHIP OR PARK** — 2 session max on internal projects, then v1 or park
- **OPEN IN BROWSER** — Always `open` HTML outputs proactively
- **HP = HB** — Voice transcription artifact
- **PDF: ALWAYS pdftotext** — Never Read tool on inbox PDFs
- **DONE → LOG: → ARCHIVE** — Never archive without recording in LOG: card
- **RUN `stream stale` BEFORE RESUMING** — Check freshness before picking up parked streams
- **RAISED CAP = 5** — More than 5 → kill weakest. Weight - Friction = Pull.
- **LOCAL FIRST** — Never depend on Notion availability. Sync when token works.

## HOW TO USE THIS

1. Open new Claude Code in `/projects/` directory
2. Paste this entire file as first message
3. Or run `/briefing` for dynamic context (reads HUD + sessions + Notion + session map)
4. Or run `/stream` for stream dashboard
5. State what you want to work on
6. Claude reads relevant project.json + files before starting

**To refresh this file:** Run `/session-update` at end of any session — it regenerates LAUNCH.md with current state.
