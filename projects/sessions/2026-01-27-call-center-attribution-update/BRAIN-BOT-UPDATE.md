## Example Conversations Brain-Bot Can Now Handle

### User via Telegram: "What's the status of the call center project?"

**Brain-bot response:**
> "Looking at your Jan 27 session on call center attribution...
>
> Status: Analysis complete, ready for presentation
>
> Key findings:
> - 9 confirmed conversions worth ₦528M from hotline leads
> - 100% phone match accuracy (names changed, phones didn't)
> - Current attribution: ₦0 to call center
> - Proposed: 0.1% commission structure
>
> Political update: Salesperson is negotiating for 1% commission. She agrees call center deserves attribution but doesn't want it from her money. Consider alliance strategy.
>
> Next steps: Clarify current commission rate, propose joint presentation with sales team.
>
> Files: /session-packets/2026-01-27-call-center-attribution/"

### User via Telegram: "How do we prevent gaming?"

**Brain-bot response:**
> "From your gaming risk analysis...
>
> Primary gaming vector: Salespeople tell customers to use different phone number on delivery.
>
> Ultimate countermeasure: Remove gaming incentive
> - Keep salesperson commission at 7.5% regardless of lead source
> - Call center gets additional 0.1% from company margin
> - Salesperson loses ₦0 → no incentive to game
>
> Backup defenses:
> 1. Multi-source phone verification (5+ data sources)
> 2. Phone change audit trails + approval required
> 3. Monthly spot checks (10% verification)
> 4. Penalties for fraud (suspension → termination)
>
> File: /00_Inbox/jan27/GAMING_RISK_ANALYSIS.md"

### User via Telegram: "What did the salesperson say?"

**Brain-bot response:**
> "Political intelligence from today's conversation...
>
> Salesperson position:
> - Actively pushing for 1% commission (up from 0.075)
> - Agrees call center attribution is 'wrong' (unfair)
> - BUT doesn't want it 'from her money'
> - Justifies: Indoor sales does more work than power team (test drives vs technical visits)
>
> Strategic opportunity:
> - Commission structure already in flux
> - She agrees attribution should exist (moral high ground)
> - Propose alliance: She gets 1%, call center gets 0.1%, both win
>
> Next move: Message her to clarify current rate + propose joint proposal
>
> File: /session-packets/2026-01-27-call-center-attribution-update/POLITICAL-INTEL-UPDATE.md"
