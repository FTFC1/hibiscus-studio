## 📄 Key Document

**[POLITICAL-INTEL-UPDATE.md](POLITICAL-INTEL-UPDATE.md)** - Full analysis of:
- What salesperson said and what it means
- Strategic pivot from adversary to ally
- Updated commission proposal (1% + 0.1%)
- Talking points for building alliance
- Immediate action items

---

## ⚡ Immediate Actions Required

1. **Clarify commission rate:** Is "0.075" actually 7.5% or 0.075%?
2. **Propose alliance:** "Let's present together - you for 1%, me for 0.1%"
3. **Update documents:** Reframe as unified proposal, not competing asks

---

## 💡 Key Insight

She's already making the case for **differential commission** (indoor sales does more work than power/gas technical teams). This SUPPORTS your argument that different roles deserve different attribution rates.

**Use her logic:**
- Power team: Technical visits (different rate)
- Indoor sales: Closing work (1%)
- Call center: Lead generation (0.1%)
- **All different roles, all deserve attribution**

## 🎬 Next Move

Message salesperson:
> "I support your 1% ask - you deserve it. What if we presented together? You get 1% for closing, call center gets 0.1% for lead gen. We're aligned, not competing. 15 min call to discuss?"

---

**Status:** Awaiting clarification on current commission rate and response to alliance proposal.

**Risk Level:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Could go either way (alliance or opposition)

**Opportunity Level:** 🟢 HIGH - Commission structure already in negotiation, perfect timing
