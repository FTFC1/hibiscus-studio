# Political Intelligence Update: Salesperson Negotiation

**Date:** 2026-01-27 (Update)
**Status:** 🟡 STRATEGY PIVOT REQUIRED
**Context:** Critical conversation with salesperson reveals active commission negotiation

---

## 🚨 NEW INTELLIGENCE

### Salesperson's Position (Direct Quote Context)

**What she said:**
> - Currently pushing for 1% commission with management
> - Current rate: "0.075" (need to clarify if 7.5% or 0.075%)
> - Indoor sales commission is LESS than outdoor/power teams
> - Agrees call center attribution is "wrong" (unfair)
> - **BUT:** "doesn't want it to come out of her money"
> - Justification: "Many tasks involved in closing like test drive, unlike in power where technical team goes to site"

---

## 🎯 What This Changes

### BEFORE (Your Original Strategy)
```
Assumption: Salespeople get 7.5%, we want 0.1% from company
Risk: Salespeople resist because they fear losing money
Strategy: Prove call center value, propose 0.1% addition
```

### AFTER (New Reality)
```
Discovery: Commission structure is IN ACTIVE NEGOTIATION
Opportunity: She AGREES call center deserves attribution
Risk: She fears it coming "from her money"
New Strategy: ALLIANCE, not competition
```

---

## 💡 Strategic Pivot: From Adversary to Ally

### OLD FRAMING (Risky)
```
Call Center vs Salesperson
├─ "We deserve 0.1%"
├─ "That reduces my commission"
└─ Result: FIGHT over same pie
```

### NEW FRAMING (Strategic)
```
Call Center + Salesperson vs Company
├─ "We BOTH deserve fair attribution"
├─ Salesperson: "I want 1% for closing work"
├─ Call Center: "We want 0.1% for lead gen"
└─ Result: BOTH teams win, company pays
```

---

## 🔍 Critical Question to Clarify

**URGENT:** What does "currently on 0.075" mean?

### SCENARIO A: It's 7.5% (0.075 as decimal)
- She's asking to DROP to 1% (from 7.5% → 1%)
- **This doesn't make sense** - why accept 86% reduction?
- Something else is going on (sliding scale? Different products?)

### SCENARIO B: It's 0.075% (actual basis points)
- She's asking to INCREASE to 1% (13x increase!)
- **This makes more sense** - reasonable ask for work done
- Your 0.1% is proportional to her ask

**ACTION REQUIRED:** Clarify with salesperson what current rate actually is

---

## 🎭 Her Justification (Important Context)

### Why She Deserves 1%

**Her argument:**
> "Many tasks involved in closing like test drive, unlike in power where technical team goes to site"

**Translation:**
- Power/Gas sales: Technical team does site visits → salesperson just closes
- Indoor (vehicle) sales: Salesperson does EVERYTHING (test drives, customer service, closing)
- She feels undervalued compared to other divisions
- **Fair point** - more customer touchpoints = more work

**Strategic use:**
- She's already making the case for DIFFERENTIAL commission (different roles = different rates)
- This SUPPORTS your argument (call center = different role = separate attribution)
- Use her logic: "You do closing work (1%), we do lead gen (0.1%), both necessary, both compensated"

---

## 💰 Proposed Alliance Structure

### Current State (Unclear)
```
Salesperson (outdoor/power): Higher commission (unknown %)
Salesperson (indoor/vehicles): "0.075" (7.5%? or 0.075%?)
Call Center: 0% (zero attribution)
```

### Her Ask
```
Salesperson (indoor): 1% for closing work
Call Center: (not mentioned, but agrees should exist)
```

### Your Counter-Proposal (Alliance)
```
Salesperson (indoor): 1% for closing work (HER ASK)
Call Center: 0.1% for lead generation (YOUR ASK)
Total: 1.1% clearly attributed

FOR HOTLINE LEADS:
├─ Salesperson: 1% (closing)
├─ Call Center: 0.1% (lead gen)
└─ Total: 1.1%

FOR OUTSIDE LEADS (walk-in, referral):
├─ Salesperson: 1% (sourcing + closing)
├─ Call Center: 0%
└─ Total: 1%
```

**What Salesperson Loses:** ₦0 (she gets her 1% either way)

---

## 🗣️ Talking Points: Building the Alliance

### MESSAGE TO SALESPERSON

**Acknowledge her position:**
> "I completely agree you deserve 1% for the work you do - test drives, customer handholding, closing the deal. You're right that indoor sales involves more customer touchpoint work than technical teams do on power/gas deals."

**Propose alliance:**
> "I'm NOT trying to take that from you. Here's what I'm thinking:
>
> - You push for your 1% (closing work)
> - I push for call center's 0.1% (lead generation)
> - We present TOGETHER as a unified proposal
>
> That way we're both asking the company to recognize our contributions. You get your 1%, call center gets 0.1%, and we're not fighting over the same commission."

**Show her the math:**
```
SCENARIO A: You claim "outside lead"
├─ You: 1% = ₦600,000
├─ Call center: 0% = ₦0
└─ Total: ₦600,000

SCENARIO B: Hotline lead with attribution
├─ You: 1% = ₦600,000 (SAME!)
├─ Call center: 0.1% = ₦60,000 (company pays)
└─ Total: ₦660,000

YOU LOSE: ₦0
```

**Eliminate her fear:**
> "The 0.1% for call center is ADDITIONAL from company margin. It doesn't come from your 1%. You get the same ₦600k whether it's a hotline lead or an outside lead."

## 📊 Updated Commission Proposal (Alliance Version)

### For ₦60M Vehicle Sale

**IF HOTLINE-SOURCED:**
```
├─ Salesperson: 1% = ₦600,000 (closing work)
├─ Call center: 0.1% = ₦60,000 (lead generation)
└─ Total company cost: ₦660,000
```

**IF OUTSIDE LEAD (walk-in, referral):**
```
├─ Salesperson: 1% = ₦600,000 (sourcing + closing)
├─ Call center: 0% = ₦0 (no involvement)
└─ Total company cost: ₦600,000
```

**Salesperson's perspective:**
- Hotline lead: "I did less work (no sourcing), got ₦600k"
- Outside lead: "I did more work (sourcing + closing), got ₦600k"
- **Fair? Debatable, but she loses ₦0 on attribution**

---

## 🎯 Updated Pitch to Management

### OLD PITCH (Call Center Alone)
```
Problem: Call center generates ₦528M, gets ₦0 attribution
Solution: Give call center 0.1% commission
Benefit: Fair compensation, better morale
Risk: Salespeople push back
```

### NEW PITCH (Unified Front)
```
Problem: Commission structure doesn't properly attribute work across teams
Evidence:
├─ Call center generates leads (₦528M proven), gets 0%
├─ Salespeople do closing work, feel undervalued vs other divisions
└─ Current structure creates disputes and unfairness

Solution: Clear attribution model
├─ Salesperson: 1% for closing work (reflects customer-facing effort)
├─ Call Center: 0.1% for lead generation (reflects proven conversions)
└─ Different roles, different rates, both recognized

Benefit:
├─ Fair compensation for both teams
├─ No infighting (both teams aligned)
├─ Clear attribution (prevents disputes)
└─ Sustainable process (monthly matching)

Support:
├─ Sales team agrees call center should get attribution
├─ Both teams support this structure
└─ Harder for management to reject when teams are aligned
```

## 🚦 Immediate Next Steps

### STEP 1: Clarify Current Commission Rate (Urgent)

**MESSAGE TO SALESPERSON:**
> "Quick clarification - when you said you're currently on 0.075, did you mean:
> - 7.5% (0.075 as a decimal), OR
> - 0.075% (75 basis points)?
>
> Want to make sure I understand the numbers correctly when we present this."

**Why this matters:**
- If 7.5% → 1%: Something doesn't add up (massive reduction)
- If 0.075% → 1%: Makes sense (13x increase, reasonable ask)

---

### STEP 2: Propose Alliance (If She's Open)

**MESSAGE TO SALESPERSON:**
> "Hey, thought more about our conversation. I want to support your push for 1% - you absolutely deserve it.
>
> What if we presented a joint proposal to management?
> - You get 1% for sales work
> - Call center gets 0.1% for lead generation
> - We show management how proper attribution benefits everyone
>
> That way we're aligned, not competing. You lose nothing, call center gets recognition. Worth a quick chat?"

**If she says yes:** Schedule 15-min call to align on messaging
**If she says no:** Proceed solo but frame it as "Sales team agrees attribution should exist"

---

### STEP 3: Update Presentation Documents

**What to change:**

**FROM:**
> "Call center deserves 0.1%, salesperson keeps current 7.5%"

**TO:**
> "Both teams deserve fair attribution:
> - Salesperson: 1% (closing work - their ask)
> - Call center: 0.1% (lead generation - our ask)
> - Total: 1.1%, both teams win"

## 🤔 Open Questions

### For Salesperson
1. What's actual current commission rate (7.5% or 0.075%)?
2. Is she willing to ally on joint proposal?
3. Can she influence other salespeople?
4. Is her negotiation with management official or informal?

### For Management
5. Does management know about her 1% ask?
6. Who has authority to change commission structure?
7. What's budget for commission structure changes?
8. Is this negotiation happening for all salespeople or just her?

### For Head of Operations
9. Is he aware of salesperson's negotiation?
10. Would he support unified proposal from both teams?
11. What's his relationship with Head of Sales?

---

## 🎯 Success Scenarios

### BEST CASE: Alliance Works
```
├─ Salesperson allies with you
├─ Present unified proposal to management
├─ Management sees aligned teams (harder to reject)
├─ Both teams get fair attribution
└─ You're seen as problem-solver (built coalition)
```

### MIDDLE CASE: She Doesn't Ally, But Doesn't Oppose
```
├─ Salesperson pursues her 1% separately
├─ You present call center 0.1% independently
├─ Both proposals considered on merit
├─ No active opposition from sales team
└─ Outcome depends on management appetite for change
```

### WORST CASE: She Actively Opposes
```
├─ Salesperson sees call center attribution as threat
├─ Lobbies against it (fears it reduces her ask)
├─ Management has to choose between proposals
├─ Political capital spent fighting sales team
└─ Lower chance of success
```

**Strategic priority:** Aim for BEST CASE, prepare for MIDDLE CASE

## 📝 Key Takeaways

### ✅ What This Confirms

1. **Commission structure is in flux** - she's actively negotiating
2. **Attribution is acknowledged as unfair** - she agrees it's "wrong"
3. **Fear is economic loss** - "doesn't want it from her money"
4. **Different roles deserve different rates** - her own argument (test drives vs site visits)

### 🎯 What This Enables

1. **Timing is perfect** - structure is being renegotiated anyway
2. **Moral high ground** - she agrees call center deserves attribution
3. **Alliance opportunity** - frame as "us vs company" not "us vs each other"
4. **Differential attribution** - her logic supports your proposal

### ⚠️ What This Risks

1. **She could oppose** - if she thinks it threatens her 1%
2. **Management could reject both** - "too expensive" at 1.1% total
3. **Other salespeople could push back** - if they weren't consulted
4. **Expectations mismatch** - if you don't clarify current rate

## 💬 Updated Talking Points (Alliance Version)

### To Salesperson:
> "I support your 1% ask. Let's present together - you for closing, me for lead gen. We both win."

### To Call Center:
> "Sales team agrees you deserve attribution. We're aligning with them, not fighting them."

### To Head of Operations:
> "Both teams have aligned on fair attribution structure. Sales wants 1% for closing work, call center wants 0.1% for lead generation. Total 1.1% reflects actual work done."

### To Management:
> "Current commission structure creates disputes. Proposed structure (1% sales + 0.1% call center) provides clear attribution, prevents gaming, and fairly compensates both teams. ROI is 105x."

---

**STATUS:** Awaiting clarification on current commission rate before proceeding with alliance proposal.

**NEXT MOVE:** Message salesperson to clarify 0.075 meaning + propose alliance call.
