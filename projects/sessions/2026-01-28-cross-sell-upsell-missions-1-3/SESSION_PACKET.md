## User Feedback Summary

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Overall quality:** "These missions are solid actually these missions are solid"
2. **Mission 1:** "Already think it's good" - likes implementation focus, tomorrow preview, quick tips
3. **Numbers/Math:** Really likes showing the cost (₦2.6M/year, ₦6.5M/year) - sales people are number-driven
4. **Flow:** Likes the structure (Problem → Why it costs → What to do → Practice)
5. **"Measuring Success" section:** Very useful
6. **Examples/Dialogue:** "Really useful" to show good vs. bad scripts

### 🔧 What Needs Adjustment

#### Content Issues

1. **Anonymize sources:**
   - "Ash Luxury" is mentioned specifically - partner's ex-employer
   - Need to anonymize: "A luxury retail manager" or "A high-end retailer"
   - Keep insights, remove attribution

2. **Nigerian respect angle (LATER):**
   - "Hey" → "Good Afternoon Sir/Ma, Welcome to..."
   - Need more research before adding Nigerian cultural layer
   - Don't add this yet

3. **Simplify language:**
   - "Tend towards the simplest language possible"
   - Check for jargon or complex phrasing

4. **Numbers presentation:**
   - "Need to lay out the numbers so they can see the math"
   - Break down calculations step-by-step
   - Example: "5 lost sales/week × ₦25K = ₦125K/week → ₦6.5M/year"

#### UX/Format Issues

5. **Scrolling problem:**
   - "Practice today" says "use your chosen opening" but openings are higher up
   - Users have to scroll to reference
   - **Potential solutions:**
     - Repeat key points in practice section
     - Create separate "Quick Reference" card
     - Platform feature: collapsible sections

6. **Progressive disclosure:**
   - "5 warm openings" - can they take it in one time?
   - Maybe show 1-2, then reveal more as they progress?
   - Or: Day 1 practice Opening 1, Day 2 practice Opening 2, etc.

7. **Script length:**
   - Good/bad dialogue examples are useful but long
   - "Is there a better way to show scripts while keeping them readable?"
   - Maybe: bullet-point format? Visual treatment?

#### Platform Questions (Open)

8. **Tracking:**
   - Need progress dashboard: mission completion + basket size
   - Track content viewing OR track quiz completion?
   - Leaning towards: track quiz/practice completion, not just reading

9. **Delivery platform options:**
   - **Option A:** Drip campaign in Craft documents (shared folder, free app)
   - **Option B:** Course platform with quizzes
   - **Option C:** Telegram bot that delivers daily + can answer questions
   - **Hybrid:** Content in Craft/docs + Telegram bot for delivery + check-ins

10. **Bot features (advanced, not MVP):**
    - Daily check-in: "How did you do today?"
    - Tracks user progress
    - Can reference content: "Show me the 5 warm openings"
    - Voice recognition for Nigerian accent - TOO COMPLEX for now

11. **How do they keep track?**
    - With 24 missions, how do they remember everything?
    - Reference library accessible anytime
    - Bot can remind/quiz them
    - Need solution for this

## Decisions Made

### In Scope for Now
✅ Text-based missions (800-1,200 words each)
✅ Emoji system for readability
✅ Infographics (user will generate images)
✅ Layer 1 (70% reusable) + Layer 3 (PUMA-specific)
✅ Nigerian context in examples, but not full localization yet

### Deferred (Later)
⏸️ Nigerian cultural layer (Sir/Ma, local greetings, etc.) - need more research
⏸️ Voice/Nigerian accent recognition - too complex
⏸️ Advanced bot progress tracking - nice to have, not MVP
⏸️ Video content - v2 feature

### Open Questions
❓ **Platform:** Craft docs vs. course platform vs. Telegram bot vs. hybrid?
❓ **Tracking:** Content viewing vs. quiz completion?
❓ **Progressive disclosure:** Show all 5 openings at once or drip them?
❓ **Reference library:** How do they access info without scrolling endlessly?

## Questions for User

1. **Platform decision:** Should we prototype in Craft docs first to see how the scrolling/reference issue feels? Or wait until we have 6-10 missions?

2. **Progressive disclosure:** For the "5 warm openings" - should Mission 2 introduce all 5, or should we spread them across multiple days? (Day 1: Opening 1-2, Day 2: Opening 3-4, etc.)

3. **Anonymization level:** How generic? "A luxury retailer" or "A high-end store in Lagos" or just "A retail manager"?

4. **Mission 7 priority:** Should I create Mission 7 (Automatic Add-On) next, or finish Module 1 (Missions 4-6) first?

5. **Reference library format:** Should we create a separate "Quick Reference" document that consolidates all scripts/frameworks/checklists in one place?

**Status:** Awaiting decisions on platform and next mission priorities.
