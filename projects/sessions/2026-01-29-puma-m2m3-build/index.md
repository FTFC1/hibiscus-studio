# Session Packet: PUMA M2+M3 Build Planning

**Session Date:** 2026-01-29
**Project:** FORJE Retail Training (PUMA Pilot)
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress

---

## summary

Planned and started building Modules 2+3 (Cross-Sell / Upsell) for PUMA retail training. Created Mission 7 lesson. Explored practice game options for product matching drill.

---

## decisions made

### 1. 80/20 Build Order
- Write M7 (Add-On) + M15 (Trade-Up) first — these 2 missions = 80% of cross-sell/upsell value
- Put on Selar live (even partial)
- Build Telegram demo
- Show Timi → Adedolapo → invoice

### 2. Language Approach
- No scripts to memorize
- Give staff the **idea**, let them say it their own way
- Avoid: too American, too British, too pidgin
- Natural Nigerian retail English with honorifics (Sir, Ma)

### 3. Timeline
- "2 weeks after approval" (not fixed Feb 10 date)
- Keep building regardless — system is reusable for other clients

### 4. Telegram Engagement Risk
- Staff won't naturally share wins — flagged as HIGH RISK assumption
- Options: organic, incentivized, required posts, manager-led
- Recommendation: Manager-led + light requirement
- Question for Timi: "Does your team need a carrot?"

### 5. Practice Game Approach
- Quiz format wrong for product matching — need PRACTICE not test
- Matching game with repetition builds muscle memory
- 80/20: Simple web game + link in Telegram first
- Screenshot scores, manual leaderboard for pilot
- Full Telegram game integration later if engagement proves out

## mission 7 iterations

Built M7 lesson with multiple feedback rounds:
1. v1: Too minimal, generic "spray" reference
2. v2: Added PUMA-specific products (Suede Classic → Suede Protector)
3. v3: Added visual timeline for "when to mention it"
4. v4: Fixed arrow centering, lightened scene card (two dark boxes issue)
5. v5: Added product image placeholders, outcome cards for yes/no

**Still needed:** Actual product images from PUMA

## practice game research

Explored options for drilling product pairs:

| Approach | Effort | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Quizlet/Wordwall | Low | Feels like school, not professional |
| Custom web game + Telegram link | 2-3 hrs | Game works, manual leaderboard |
| Registered Telegram game (no auto-score) | 3-4 hrs | Opens in Telegram, still manual scores |
| Full Telegram game with auto-score | 6-8 hrs | Scores post automatically |

**Decision:** Start with simple web game (approach A). Upgrade later if engagement proves out.

## open questions

1. **Product images** — Need actual PUMA product photos for pairing cards
2. **Incentives** — How does PUMA team respond to competition? Carrot needed?
3. **Selar quiz** — Does Selar's built-in quiz work for this, or build separate?
4. **Game mechanics** — What makes matching feel like a game vs a test?

## next actions

| 1 | Build simple matching game (web, hostable) | To Do |
| 2 | Write M15 (Trade-Up) lesson | To Do |
