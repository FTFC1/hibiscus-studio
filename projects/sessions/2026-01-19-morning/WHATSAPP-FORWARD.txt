SESSION: 2026-01-19 Morning (pre-birthday)

🎯 MAIN INSIGHT:
Whop ecosystem = your distribution layer
Invoice → Payment tracking → Retail training → HB Studio apps
One platform, multiple products

⚠️ PATTERN TO FIX:
"Know the path but don't push"
- Case study page (know, not doing)
- AI course (paused, not implementing)
- Constraints drop when not documented

📱 BUILD IDEA:
Telegram bot for voice collab
- Auto-transcribe voice notes
- Context header at top
- Inline quick actions
- Export day's conversation
- YUH group pattern already exists

🔧 FRICTION TO SOLVE:
WhatsApp .opus → MacWhisper = too many steps
Bottleneck blindness (can't see time drain)

📋 WHEN BACK:
1. EOD review in HUD
2. Push on case study page
3. Document physical constraints (they drop)
