# Title / Role Suggestions

Based on your range: Chemical Engineering → Optimization Analyst → Product Designer → Code/System Builder

---

## Option 1: **Systems Engineer × Product Designer**

**Why this works:**
- Captures both technical depth (systems engineering) and UX thinking (product design)
- "×" (multiply symbol) implies synergy, not just addition
- Systems engineering = broad enough to cover code, data, optimization, architecture
- Product designer = strategic thinking, user-centered, not just visual

**What it signals:**
- You build systems, not just features
- You think about the user experience, not just technical implementation
- You bridge business problems and technical solutions

---

## Option 2: **Product Engineer**

**Why this works:**
- Increasingly common title at tech companies
- Implies: I ship products, not just code
- Covers full stack: strategy → design → build → iterate
- Less narrow than "software engineer" or "full-stack developer"

**What it signals:**
- End-to-end ownership (not just frontend or backend)
- Product thinking embedded in technical work
- Outcome-focused, not task-focused

---

## Option 3: **Workflow Automation Engineer**

**Why this works:**
- Descriptive of what you actually do (eliminate manual work)
- "Workflow" = process optimization (your optimization analyst background)
- Attracts clients with manual overhead problems
- Clear value proposition in the title

**What it signals:**
- I automate repetitive work
- I understand business processes
- I focus on ROI (time/cost savings)

**Risk:**
- Might sound narrow (just automation, not full system builds)
- Could attract only "automate this task" requests vs strategic builds

---

## Option 4: **Technical Product Strategist**

**Why this works:**
- Emphasizes strategic thinking (you ask "what's expensive?" not "what do you want built?")
- "Technical" = I can actually build it, not just consult
- Matches how you work: discover problem → design solution → ship incrementally

**What it signals:**
- I don't just take orders
- I help you figure out what to build
- I can execute on the strategy

**Risk:**
- "Strategist" might imply consultant/advisor only
- Less clear that you write code

---

## Option 5: **Design Engineer**

**Why this works:**
- Emerging role at companies like Vercel, Linear, Stripe
- Design-first engineering: craft matters, UX matters, aesthetics matter
- Captures your product design background + technical execution
- Signals: polished output, not just functional

**What it signals:**
- I care about how it looks and feels
- Mobile-first, responsive, visual polish
- User experience embedded in technical decisions

**Risk:**
- Might sound frontend-heavy
- Could undersell systems/backend work

---

## Recommendation: **Systems Engineer × Product Designer**

**Reasoning:**
1. Covers full range (optimization, code, design, system thinking)
2. Differentiates from "software engineer" or "full-stack developer"
3. Positions you as strategic (product designer) + technical (systems engineer)
4. Flexible enough to fit all your projects (HB Studio, Motor Stock, Brain-Bot, PUMA)
5. Not pigeonholed into narrow category

**Alternative if too broad:** "Product Engineer" (simpler, still captures both sides)
