# Session Update — January 31, 2026

**Session Type:** Research + Planning
**Duration:** ~3 hours
**Key Deliverables:** Coaches/consultants market validation + HB Studio portal planning

---

## Summary

Completed comprehensive market validation for coaches/consultants ICP (Rochelle's recommendation: "start with them first, better fit"). Validated with **38/50 EP Framework score** (76% viability). Processed Rochelle's screen recordings showing Fresha pain points + Francesca London funnel (training/workshop model). Created ASCII planning document for HB Studio customer + admin portals.

---

## Key Decisions Made

### **1. ICP Pivot Validated: Coaches/Consultants First**

**Rochelle's Guidance:**
> "Start with coaches and consultants (better fit for you), then studios, then beauty industry"

**Research Validation:**
- Coaches: **38/50** (Strong commercial viability)
- Beauty: **41/50** (from earlier research)
- **Difference:** Coaches prefer SaaS over custom dev (need pricing pivot)

**Strategic Shift:**
- Don't position as traditional custom dev (£20k upfront)
- Position as **"Custom SaaS"** (£2-5k setup + £100-250/month)
- Target mid-to-high revenue coaches (£60k-200k/year, 15+ clients/month)

**Why Coaches First:**
- Less emotional/visual selling needed (logical buyers)
- Faster sales cycle (no hand-holding)
- Francesca London example IS a coach/educator (£549 masterclasses)

---

### **2. Pricing Model Refinement**

**Problem:** £20k upfront custom dev = 17-83% of coach annual revenue (prohibitive)

**Solution:**
- Setup fee: **£2,000-5,000** (one-time)
- Monthly subscription: **£100-250/month** (includes hosting, maintenance, updates)
- **Year 1 total: £3,200-8,000** (competitive with Calendly + Acuity + HoneyBook stack)

**This solves:**
- Affordability objection
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Trust barrier (looks like SaaS, feels like custom)

---

### **3. HB Studio Portal Scope Defined**

**Customer Portal MVP (Priority 1 — Build Now):**
- View bookings (past + future)
- Reschedule appointment
- Cancel appointment
- View/pay invoices
- Account settings (email, phone, password, notifications)

**Admin Portal Enhancements (Priority 2 — IF Needed):**
- Workshop/event management (if Rochelle pivots to training like Francesca)
- Advanced reporting
- Custom intake forms
- Notification center (Telegram already built)

**Decision:** Build MVP first (2-3 weeks), test with Rochelle, then decide on V2 based on feedback.

## Research Findings

### **Coaches/Consultants Market Validation**

**EP Framework Score: 38/50 (76%)**

| Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Urgency** | 9/10 | "Hours on scheduling/invoicing when they could be coaching" |
| **Market Size** | 8/10 | 370,000+ UK LinkedIn coaching professionals, 56% sole proprietors |
| **Willingness to Pay** | 6/10 | Prefer SaaS (68%), but spend £600-2,400/year already |
| **Accessibility** | 8/10 | LinkedIn strongest channel, ICF/EMCC communities active |
| **Expertise** | 7/10 | Case studies critical (50%+ B2B buyers need), coaching vertical proof |

**Key Insights:**
- Typical coach earns £100-£500/session (1-on-1) or £800-£2,500/month packages
- Executive coaches: £500-£1,475/session
- Workshops: £450+/person (Francesca London charges £549)
- Average client volume: 12-13 clients/month
- Current software spend: £600-£2,400/year (Calendly + Acuity + HoneyBook)

**Comparison to Beauty Industry:**
- Beauty scored 3 points higher (41 vs 38)
- Beauty has better "Willingness to Pay" (8 vs 6) — already paying £6k-18k/year in Fresha fees
- Coaches have equal urgency, market size, and expertise requirements
- **Rochelle was right:** Coaches are better starting point (less visual selling, logical buyers)

---

### **Rochelle's Screen Recordings Analysis**

**Video 1: Fresha Backend (IMG_5088.MP4, 5:38)**

**What it showed:** CLIENT perspective of Fresha (not business backend)

**Key insights from transcription:**
- Revenue data: Beauty businesses earning **£3k-5k/week** (£12k-20k/month = £156k-260k/year)
- Fresha's 6.9% fee = **£10.8k-18k/year** in platform costs
- Marketplace pain: Clients browse competitors ("Russian infill, lashes, nails, more lashes")
- Custom intake forms: "Would you like a beverage?" (personalization example)
- "Book again" feature convenient BUT keeps client in Fresha ecosystem

**Pain points validated:**
- Marketplace churn risk (competitors displayed to clients)
- High platform fees (7-10% of gross revenue)
- Vendor lock-in (clients comfortable with Fresha, hard to migrate)

---

**Video 2: Francesca London Funnel (IMG_5090.MP4, 1:52)**

**What it showed:** High-performing custom booking funnel (NOT Fresha-dependent)

**Business Model:**
- Services: Lash appointments (£32-150)
- Training: **"The Artistry Edit" masterclass — £549/person**
- Collaboration: Francesca X Jodie (2 instructors)

**Economics (Rochelle's Calculation):**
- 12 attendees × £549 = **£7,500 revenue**
- Studio rental: £500
- Other expenses: £1,500
- **Total costs:** £2,000
- **Profit:** £5,000 (£2,500 per instructor per day)

**Key Features Observed:**
- Custom website (francescalondon.com)
- Clean navigation: Training Courses, Services, Login (customer portal!)
- E-commerce integration: "ADD TO CART"
- Emotional copywriting: "Each appointment begins with a personal consultation..."
- Social proof via Instagram content marketing

**Why This Matters:**
- This is a **TRAINING/EDUCATION business model** (coaches/consultants use same model)
- Validates coaches research: workshops/masterclasses are core revenue stream
- HB Studio may need workshop management feature if Rochelle adds training

---

### **Rochelle's Masterclass Economics Example**

**Context:** She mentioned Artistry Edit masterclass during conversation

**Quote:**
> "12 people is seven and a half grand for one day. They're renting the studio for 500. Let's say all of their expenses, everything together is two thousand. They're left with five grand. That's two and a half grand for one day that each of them get for just one, that one class."

**Translation:**
- Workshop revenue model: £7,500 gross → £5,000 profit → £2,500/instructor/day
- This is **HIGHER per-day earnings** than 1-on-1 sessions (£150 × 10 clients = £1,500/day)
- Group workshops = high-leverage income (teach 12 people at once)

**Relevance:**
- Coaches run workshops (same model)
- Consultants run masterclasses (same model)
- Fitness trainers run bootcamps (same model)
- System must support workshop registration + capacity limits + payment

---

## Rochelle's Strategic Feedback

### **1. Emotional Visual Selling**

**Quote:**
> "Instead of being too text heavy and technical, you need to play on emotions. Make a mock-up of a fake client where you've changed their booking and show it visually and then talking it through with them, I think that would guarantee more sales."

**What this means:**
- Don't just list features ("custom booking, invoice PDF, calendar sync")
- Show CLIENT JOURNEY (like her Fresha video)
- Narrate transformation (pain → solution → relief)
- Visual walkthrough > text-heavy portfolio

**Action item:** Create visual demo (Remotion MCP for programmatic video generation suggested)

---

### **2. ICP Sequencing**

**Quote:**
> "Start with the coaches and consultants, that might be better for you. Then go into studios, then like with mine, like you did photography, creative, fitness studio, then agencies, then cleaning companies."

**Priority Order:**
1. **Coaches & Consultants** (START HERE — better fit)
2. Studios (photography, creative, fitness)
3. Agencies
4. Cleaning companies
5. Beauty industry (LATER — after case studies)

**Rationale:**
- Coaches = logical buyers, less emotional selling, faster sales cycle
- Beauty = requires visual demos, hand-holding, longer sales cycle
- Get 2-3 coach case studies → then approach beauty with proof

---

### **3. Beauty Industry Insights**

**Quote:**
> "My next business I'm opening is in the beauty industry. So one of them is. So just do the research now because we're going to need it anyway."

**Context:**
- Rochelle is opening a beauty business herself
- Beauty research valuable for her future needs
- But user should sell to coaches FIRST, then use learnings for beauty later

## Strategic Insights

### **1. Workshop/Training Model Applies Across ICPs**

**Observation:**
- Francesca London: Lash educator running £549 masterclasses
- Coaches: Run business workshops (£450-£1,000/person)
- Fitness trainers: Run group bootcamps
- Consultants: Run executive workshops

**System Requirement:**
- Need workshop/event management feature (capacity limits, registration, attendee tracking)
- This is NOT beauty-specific, it's EDUCATOR-specific
- HB Studio may need this if Rochelle adds training
- Coaches/consultants DEFINITELY need this

---

### **2. SaaS vs Custom Development Psychology**

**Problem:**
- 68% of young businesses prefer SaaS over custom development
- Custom dev perceived as expensive (£20k+), risky, high-maintenance

**Solution:**
- Position as "white-label SaaS with customization" (not "bespoke development")
- Subscription model (£100-250/month) feels like SaaS
- One-time setup (£2-5k) amortizes over 12 months (£166-416/month equivalent)
- Total Year 1: £3,200-8,000 = competitive with premium SaaS stacks

**Messaging:**
- ❌ "We'll build you a custom CRM from scratch"
- ✅ "We'll customize our proven coaching platform to your exact workflow"

---

### **3. Proof Requirements: Case Studies > Features**

**Research Finding:**
- 50% of B2B buyers read case studies before deciding
- 85% of clients value credentials
- Testimonials "believed much more than anything you say"

**For Coaches:**
- Need 2-3 case studies with metrics ("Cut admin from 10 hours to 2 hours/week")
- Video testimonials > written testimonials
- Coaching vertical proof (can't use HB Studio beauty case study alone)

**For Beauty (Later):**
- Visual demos critical (Rochelle's feedback)
- Before/after mockups
- Emotional storytelling
