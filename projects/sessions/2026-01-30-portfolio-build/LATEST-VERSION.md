## What Changed (v3 → v4)

### **Simplified Above-Fold (Hero Section)**

**BEFORE (v3):**
```
SYSTEMS DESIGNER

I free up 10-15 hours/week
so you can take on more clients
without hiring

[paragraph about capacity problem]

[ROI calculation box: 40 hours/month = ₦2M...]

[GET 10 HOURS BACK]  [SEE PROOF]
```

**AFTER (v4):**
```
SYSTEMS DESIGNER

I free up 10-15 hours/week
so you can take on more clients
without hiring

[GET 10 HOURS BACK]  ← Single full-width CTA
```

**Moved Below Results Section:**
- Intro paragraph (capacity problem context)
- ROI calculation box (40 hours/month math)

---

## Why This Works Better

**User feedback:** "Too much text wanting attention above fold"

**Problem:** 4 competing elements:
1. Headline
2. Paragraph
3. ROI box
4. Two buttons

**Solution:** 1 clear message + 1 action
- Headline: What you get (10 hours back)
- CTA: How to start (single button)
- Everything else: Proof/explanation (after you scroll)

**EP Principle:** Confused buyer doesn't buy.

   - Label: SYSTEMS DESIGNER
   - Headline: Outcome (10 hours back)
