# Session Packet: Portfolio Build

**Session Date:** 2026-01-30
**Project:** Personal Development (Automation Portfolio)
**Status:** 🟡 Design Pivot in Progress → Light Mode (Test + Deploy Tomorrow)

## Context

Friday self-investment session. Building a professional portfolio that showcases recent work while protecting client confidentiality. Applying EP Course methodology instead of winging it.

## Approach

◇ EP-informed strategy (leveraging AI as strategic partner)
◇ Session packet review (understand deliverable patterns)
◇ Strategic redaction (what to show vs hide)
◇ Plan mode consideration (user's preference)

## Research Complete

✓ Session packets analyzed (Jan 19-30, 2026)
✓ EP Course positioning framework extracted
✓ 4 major projects identified with quantified value
✓ Technical capabilities mapped across domains

## Active Files

- This index (session tracker)
- Decisions log (TBD)
- Portfolio structure/content (TBD)

## Project Inventory (Ready for Portfolio)

**1. Hibiscus Studio** - SaaS booking automation
→ Business value: 100% manual process eliminated, salary commitment confirmed
→ Tech: Cloudflare Workers, Google Calendar API, PDF gen, email automation

**2. Brain-Bot** - Telegram PKM for ADHD workflows
→ Business value: Sovereign knowledge layer, action priority surfacing
→ Tech: Telegram Bot API, SQLite embeddings, Claude API, Whisper transcription

**3. Forje Retail Training** - Microlearning for Nigerian retail
→ Business value: ₦2.955M PUMA pilot, 80/20 mission focus
→ Tech: Responsive HTML presentations, instructional design, cultural localization

**4. Motor Stock Automation** - Daily inventory reporting
→ Business value: 450+ hours saved annually (95% time reduction)
→ Tech: Python ETL, Telegram Mini Apps, complex data transformation

## EP Framework Application

**Authority Strategy:** The Methodology
→ "Proprietary session packet system for AI-assisted delivery"
→ "HUD over HD" visual brief philosophy
→ "Sovereign architecture" approach (local-first, platform-agnostic)

**Proof Hierarchy:** Lead with Tier 1 (Results)
→ Specific numbers: 95% time reduction, ₦2.955M pilot, 450 hours/year saved
→ User testimonials: "Actually really good", "Pretty excited"
→ Speed metrics: 4-hour priority system ship, same-day iterations

**Portfolio Structure Recommendation:**
- Hero: One-liner positioning statement
- Case studies: 3-4 projects with numbers
- Methodology: Session packets + sovereign approach
- Social proof: Client feedback + speed metrics
- CTA: Clear next steps

## Positioning Discovery (In Progress)

**Background Context:**
- Chemical Engineering → Optimization Analyst → Product Designer (German healthtech)
- INTJ systems thinker
- Comfortable not knowing, asks expensive questions first
- Incremental delivery (skateboard → car model)

**Core Differentiator Identified:**
"I find the expensive problem you can't see and fix it iteratively"

**Challenge:**
Need engagement boundary that allows iteration but prevents endless scope creep.

Options explored:
- 10-day sprints (what if 8 or 12?)
- Single problem (dependencies expand scope)
- Discovery/Build/Handoff (not iterative)
- MVP→Iterate→Graduate (no time bound)

**Current thinking:** Hybrid model needed - sprint-based with natural graduation points.

## Decisions Made

✓ Case study title: "Event Studio Booking Automation" (outcome-focused)
✓ Lead with results (eliminate manual work) not features
✓ Full brand anonymization (Event Studio, not Hibiscus)
✓ Positioning: The Methodology (EP Course framework)
✓ Engagement model: Sprint-based with natural graduation
  - Sprint 1 (Small, 3-5 days): Core problem solved
  - Decision point: Client chooses to continue or graduate
  - Sprint 2+ (Medium, 7-10 days): Enhancements/optimization
  - Each sprint is independent deliverable
✓ Capacity model: 2 intensive sprints + 2 enhancement slots + analysis/spec (bounded)
✓ Contact method: Form with qualifier questions (prevent unqualified calls)
✓ CTA: "Currently at capacity" (accurate) → shifts to "slots available" when open

## Three Positioning Variations (User to Choose)

**A:** "I find the expensive problems in your business and fix them"
- Most marketing-focused
- Positions as strategic problem-finder
- "Expensive" might need clarification

**B:** "Small sprint → Prove value → You decide if we continue"
- Closest to truth of how work actually happens
- Emphasizes low-risk, iterative approach
- "Small sprint" might sound less valuable

**C:** "I eliminate manual work in 7-10 day sprints"
- Easiest to understand
- Clear value proposition (automation)
- Specific timeframe sets expectations

## Title/Role Recommendation

**Primary:** Systems Engineer × Product Designer
- Covers technical depth + strategic thinking
- Bridges business problems and technical solutions
- Not pigeonholed as "just frontend" or "just backend"

**Alternative:** Product Engineer (simpler, still captures both sides)

## Active Files Built

- index.md (this session tracker - updated)
- case-study-with-variations.html (4 visual problem styles to choose from)
  - Variation A: Before/After Comparison Table
  - Variation B: Process Flow Diagram (7-step manual workflow)
  - Variation C: Pain Points Grid (8 cards, scannable)
  - Variation D: Timeline (before/after with time metrics)
- portfolio-variations.html (3 complete portfolio landing pages)
  - Version A: "I find expensive problems..." positioning
  - Version B: "Small sprint → Prove value..." positioning
  - Version C: "I eliminate manual work..." positioning
  - Each includes: Hero, Case Study, Process, Contact Form
  - Switcher buttons to toggle between versions
- title-suggestions.md (5 role options with reasoning)

## User Decisions Made

1. ✓ **Visual Problem Style:** Timeline (Variation D) - "easily the best one"
2. ✓ **Positioning:** Version C - "I eliminate manual work in 7-10 day sprints" (easiest to understand)
3. ✓ **Title/Role:** Systems Designer (no coding assumption, covers strategic + execution)

## Iteration History

**First draft (portfolio-final.html):**
- Generic web aesthetic (light colors, rounded corners, decorative fonts)
- User feedback: "looks shitty", "AI generated", doesn't match HUD style

**Second iteration (portfolio-hud-style.html):**
- Rebuilt in user's HUD aesthetic (pure black, monospace, functional)
- Replaced before/after table with TIME BARS (much more visual)
- Fixed process language (Step 1: "You Describe Pain" not "Find Manual Work")
- Removed confusing "expensive" language in Step 2
- Increased font sizes throughout (accessibility for 30+ audience)
- Thicker time bars (8px → 16px)
- Muted capacity bar color (bright red → muted #533)
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile

## Final File Built (Iterated to HUD Style)

**portfolio-hud-style.html** - Complete one-page portfolio (final version)
- **Style:** Pure black (#000), monospace (SF Mono/Monaco), teal accent (#4a9) - matches user's HUD aesthetic
- **Hero:** Systems Designer, "I eliminate manual work in 7-10 day sprints"
- **Case Study:** Event Studio with TIME BARS (visual before/after comparison)
  - Before: 45 min (red bar, full width)
  - After: 30 sec (teal bar, tiny sliver)
  - Instantly shows 95% reduction
- **Process:** 4-step workflow with accurate language
  - Step 1: "You Describe Pain" (not "Find Manual Work")
  - Step 2: "I Find the Waste" (clarified: where you're bleeding time)
  - Step 3: Build (7-10 days)
  - Step 4: Optimize or Done
- **Results:** 4 key metrics (95% / 0 / 8-12 hr / 10 days)
- **Contact:** Form with muted red capacity bar, qualifier questions
- **Accessibility:** Font sizes increased for 30+ audience, responsive breakpoints

Browser: `file:///Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/trellomcp/trello-mcp/projects/session-packets/2026-01-30-portfolio-build/portfolio-hud-style.html`

## Design Decisions (Step Changes)

**Highest Impact Changes Made:**
1. **Time bars instead of table** - Visual shows 95% reduction instantly, not text comparison
2. **Process language fix** - Honest about flow: "You Describe Pain" → "I Find Waste" → Build
3. **Font size increase** - Accessibility for 30+ audience (decision-makers who will pay)

**What Worked:**
- HUD aesthetic (pure black, monospace, functional) over "modern web" look
- Side-by-side before/after over vertical scroll
- Visual hierarchy with small uppercase labels
- Muted colors (no bright red on black)

## Next Action Options

○ Add visual rhythm (ASCII diagrams, pull quotes, more breathing room)
○ Add Motor Stock or Brain-Bot case study (2nd example)
○ Set up contact form backend (Telegram webhook, email, or form service)
○ Deploy to production (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
○ Create PDF version for sending directly to leads

## Evening Session Update (22:00-23:00)

### EP Framework Applied (v2)

**Messaging overhaul based on EP Course Modules 2-6:**
- ❌ OLD: "I eliminate manual work in 7-10 day sprints"
- ✅ NEW: "I free up 10-15 hours/week so you can take on more clients without hiring"

**Key Changes:**
- Headline sells OUTCOME (10 hours back) not method (automation)
- Value prop block added: "₦2M/month buyback, break even in 2-3 months"
- Results moved to top (proof first, process later)
- All CTAs reframed: "Get 10 hours back" not "Automate process"
- Guarantee added: "10 hours back or another week free"
- Case study rewritten: emphasizes capacity problem, not technical details

File: `portfolio-v2-ep-copy.html`

### Responsive Fixes (v3)

**User feedback:** Results grid collapsing too early, case study text too thin

**Fixes applied:**
- Results grid stays 3 columns on tablet (600-900px)
- Case study gets `.readable` class (max-width: 680px)
- Contact method changed: WhatsApp/Telegram/iMessage picker (no email)
- Phone/username field with helpful placeholder
- Better mobile breakpoints

File: `portfolio-v3-responsive.html`

### Backend Built (Telegram Integration)

**Express server ready for form submissions:**
- POST `/submit-lead` endpoint
- Sends formatted notification to Telegram
- CORS enabled, validation working
- Ready to deploy on Render (free tier)

```

### Design Direction Pivot (23:00)

**User reference:** Republic Note image (light, professional, data-focused)

**Current:** Dark HUD aesthetic (black background, monospace, cyan accent)
**New direction:** Light professional (off-white background, saturated blue, sans-serif)

**User insight:** "I like all the elements and colours here. But a dark mode wouldn't look as good."

**Rationale:**
- Automation portfolio targets studio/agency owners (not developers)
- Light mode = more professional for this audience
- Better for screenshots/sharing
- Financial/data aesthetic = trustworthy
- Saturated blue = tech + reliable

**What stays:**
- EP framework copy (all messaging)
- Structure (results first, case study, process, form)
- Contact method picker
- Responsive grid
- Backend integration

**What changes:**
- Color palette: #000 → #F5F5F7 (background), #4a9 → #0066FF (accent)
- Typography: Monospace → Clean sans-serif
- Results cards: Dark boxes → Light blue boxes (#E8F0FE)
- Overall aesthetic: Terminal → Professional/Financial

See: `SESSION-UPDATE.md` for full design pivot details

### Late Evening (23:45) - Simplified Hero

**User feedback:** "Too much text wanting attention above fold"

**v4 changes:**
- Removed intro paragraph from hero
- Removed ROI box from hero
- Single full-width CTA (not two buttons)
- Moved context + ROI below results section

**Flow now:**
1. Hero: Headline + single CTA (above fold)
2. Results: Numbers + context + ROI (scroll #1)
3. Case study → Process → Form

**File:** `portfolio-v4-simplified-hero.html`

**EP principle applied:** Confused buyer doesn't buy. One message, one action.

---

## Session End (2026-01-31 00:15)

### EP Course Validation Applied

**What EP Actually Says:**
- Module 2, Lesson 4: Need multiple clients to validate ICP, not just one data point
- Only 1 paying client (HB Studio) - Motor Stock doesn't count (employer, not buyer)
- Can't build validated buyer profile from one case study

**Strategy Chosen: Option A**
- Build portfolio with HB Studio as proof
- Get 2-3 more clients through referrals
- THEN validate ICP with real pattern data

**Next Actions:**
1. Ask HB Studio for referrals (one-pager created)
2. Portfolio v4 ready (spacious hero, dark HUD style)
3. Light mode + backend deployment postponed until more clients secured
4. Focus: Get 2 more bookings before optimizing positioning

**Files Ready:**
- `portfolio-v4-simplified-hero.html` - Working portfolio (spacious above-fold)
- `hb-referral-ask.md` - One-pager for asking referrals

---

## Session Continue (2026-01-31 Afternoon)

### Feedback from HB Studio Owner (Rochelle)

**Key Questions Asked:**
1. **"Do you have three different packages?"** - Wants clarity on pricing structure
2. **"Can clients edit things themselves or come back to you?"** - Asking about ongoing dependency/self-service capability
3. **"Once it's all finished, I know exactly who to refer"** - Willing to make referrals but waiting for system to be 100% complete

**Target Audience Identified:**
- Business owners overwhelmed with inquiries
- People who do courses (online educators with booking needs)
- Clients that need to book appointments
- **Broader than just studios** - coaches, consultants, course creators

**Referral Incentive:** Offered referral fee (amount TBD)

### Portfolio Updates (v4 continued)

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ **Removed client name** - "Rochelle" replaced with "Studio owner" / "owner" throughout
2. ✅ **Changed currency to GBP** - Targeting UK businesses (£50/hr, £2,000/month instead of ₦50k/hr, ₦2M/month)
3. ✅ **Visual ROI calculator** - New section with 3-column grid (10 hrs × £50 = £2,000/month)
4. ✅ **Moved ROI further down** - After case study, before process section
5. ✅ **Updated guarantee** - Split payment structure: "50% to start, 50% when live. System delivered in 10 days or second payment waived until complete"
6. ✅ **Added pricing structure** - Three tiers with specifics:

**Pricing Tiers (Added to Portfolio):**

| Tier | Price | Build Time | Good For |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Basic Booking System** | £1,000 | 7-10 days | Solo consultants, coaches, single-service |
| **Standard Automation** | £2,000 | 10-14 days | Studios, agencies, course creators (HB Studio level) |
| **Custom Build** | £3,000+ | 14-21 days | Multi-service, complex operations |

**Basic includes:** Simple form, auto invoice, confirmation email, calendar sync

**Standard includes:** Custom funnel, auto invoice + email, email automation, dual calendar sync, admin dashboard, payment tracking

**Custom includes:** Everything in Standard + recommendation engine, multiple flows, advanced features, integrations

**All packages include:** 30 days of bug fixes, 50/50 payment split, timeline guarantee

### Decisions Made

**Self-Service Capability:**
- Does NOT exist in current HB Studio build
- NOT added to portfolio (no false claims)
- Could be future feature for higher tiers

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Started at £1k/£2k/£3k+ (half of initial estimates)
- Rationale: Building portfolio, only 1 paying client, need proof before premium pricing
- Can raise prices after 3-5 case studies

**ICP Expansion:**
- Not just "studios and event spaces"
- Now includes: coaches, course creators, consultants, agencies
- Common thread: "Overwhelmed with inquiries and manual booking processes"

### Next Actions

1. **Deploy backend** (form notifications to Telegram) - 15 min setup
2. **Host portfolio live** (Netlify/GitHub Pages) - 5 min
3. **Wait for HB Studio completion** before asking Rochelle for referrals
4. **Get 2-3 more clients** to validate ICP and pricing structure

### Files Status

**portfolio-v4-simplified-hero.html** - Updated with:
- GBP pricing throughout
- Visual ROI calculator section
- Split payment guarantee
- Full pricing structure (3 tiers)
- Responsive pricing grid
- Ready for backend integration

**backend/** - Ready to deploy:
- server.js (Telegram notification)
- DEPLOY.md (instructions)
- Needs: Bot token, chat ID, Render deployment

---

## Session Continue (2026-01-31 Evening)

### Strategic Pivot: Following EP Course Methods

**User decision:** "We are adjusting our plan to the course advice because we already know this method works in 2026"

**Approach:**
- EP Course = proven foundation (validated framework, not guessing)
- Our additions = implementation helpers (research, automation, tools)
- Don't deviate from core EP principles (5-dimension validation, outcome-focused copy, proof hierarchy)

### Rochelle's Extended Feedback

**Beauty Industry Leads (UK):**
1. **Skin Orchid HQ** - skincare/aesthetics (Instagram)
2. **Hera Skin Clinic** - aesthetics clinic
3. **Tresses and Travel** - hair/beauty
4. **Lashy Dreams** - lash training (hosting masterclass, doesn't know personally)

**Key Intelligence:**
- They use **Fresha, Acuity, Treatwell** (not VAs)
- These platforms charge **5-10% per transaction** (huge pain point)
- Already familiar with booking systems (lower learning curve)
- **Pitch angle:** "Stop paying Fresha fees. Invest £1k once, keep 100%."

**New Warm Leads (Coaches):**
- **Precious** - skin membership, complex setup, most likely to invest
- **Elizabeth** - may have VA, unsure of costs
- Rochelle can introduce **after February** (waiting for meeting)
- Wants **visuals ready** before introducing (needs finished product to show)

**Geographic Targeting:**
- **UK market:** "Money conscious", "stingy" right now (Rochelle's assessment)
- **Better markets:** US, Nigeria, South Africa (more willing to spend)
- **Strategy:** Don't lock into UK-only, open to international

**Messaging That Resonates:**
- "Done for you" (hands-off)
- "Payment automation" (money in account fast)
- "Replace VA costs" (fewer people to manage)
- "Systems that work 24/7"
- "Faster payments, less money spent on VA"

### Trust Barrier Identified

**User insight:** "Will people trust me to process invoices etc... i guess that the intro's she can do"

**Problem:**
- Cold outreach to beauty industry = HIGH trust barrier (stranger touching payment systems)
- Email automation still requires account access (high trust, not low trust as initially thought)

**Solution:**
- **Warm intros from Rochelle** = trust transfer ("My friend built this for me, worked great")
- Start with referrals → Build 2-3 beauty case studies → THEN cold outreach works (you have proof)

**Low-Trust Entry Point:**
- **Fresha Fee Calculator** (zero trust needed - just a tool on website)
- They input numbers, see losses immediately
- Can convert "then and there" (no audit call, no email access needed)
- Self-serve funnel: Calculator → Results → CTA → Contact form

### ICP Consolidation

**Current situation (too many ICPs):**
1. Event Studios (HB Studio - tested, 1 client)
2. Beauty Clinics (Rochelle recommendation - untested, 4 warm leads)
3. Coaches w/ Memberships (Rochelle leads - untested, 2 warm leads)
4. ADHD Entrepreneurs (hypothesis - untested, too wide)

**EP Course guidance (Module 3, Lesson 9):** Pick ONE niche first

**Decision criteria:**
- Who has immediate warm leads?
- Who has clear pain point?
- Who can we reach organically?
- Where can we get case studies fastest?

**Rochelle's advice:** "Pick ONE niche first and rewrite the offer only for them. That alone can double close rates."

**Example (fitness studios):**
"We build booking & payment systems for fitness studios that cut admin time by 80% and increase paid bookings."

vs. generic: "I automate bookings for service-based businesses."

**Files created:**
- `market-research-skill.md` - 7-section research framework
- `perplexity-deep-research-prompt.md` - Template for Perplexity Pro (copy-paste ready)

### Beauty Industry Research Completed

**Research Method:** Claude agent with 24 web searches
**Time:** ~20 minutes
**Sources:** Multiple (market data, reviews, Reddit, Facebook groups, competitor analysis)

**VALIDATION SCORE: 41/50 - STRONG GO ✅**

**Dimension Scores:**
1. **Urgency:** 9/10 (intense financial pain)
2. **Market Size:** 8/10 (49k-61k UK businesses)
3. **Willingness to Pay:** 8/10 (currently paying £6k-18k/year)
4. **Accessibility:** 9/10 (SING Facebook group - 16k members)
5. **Expertise:** 7/10 (need 2-3 case studies for credibility)

**Key Findings:**

**Market Size:**
- 49,000-61,000 beauty businesses in UK
- £3.6bn+ industry value (2025)
- 15,000-25,000 serviceable market (right-sized businesses)
- 1,647 lash salons in England alone

**Pain Point (INTENSE):**
- Beauty businesses paying **£6,000-£18,000/year** in Fresha fees
- Customer quotes (exact language):
  - "Repeatedly charged 20% marketplace fees for clients who never came through their platform"
  - "Can't justify paying upwards of £10K per year for a booking system that doesn't respect its users"
  - "Drowning in admin work - 10-15 hours weekly on non-revenue tasks"

**Transaction Economics:**
- Average lash appointment: £50-120
- Average facials: £60-150
- Typical solo lash tech: 80-120 appointments/month
- Monthly revenue range: £4k-14k
- Fresha fees (6.9%): £276-966/month = **£3,312-11,592/year**

**Current Platform Usage:**
- **Fresha:** Market leader (6.9% fees + card processing)
- **Acuity:** £15-45/month + 4% transaction fees
- **Treatwell:** Commission-based marketplace
- **Vagaro:** 3.9% + subscription

**Competitor Pricing:**
- Fiverr: £30-600 (low quality, templates)
- UK agencies: £10k-50k (too expensive for small businesses)
- **Gap:** £2k-5k range underserved ⭐

**Pricing Recommendation (REVISED UPWARD):**

| Tier | Price | Build Time | Target |
|------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Solo/Micro** | £2,495 | 7-10 days | 1-2 staff, solo lash techs |
| **Small Business** | £3,995 | 10-14 days | 3-5 staff, small clinics |
| **Growing Salon** | £6,495 | 14-21 days | 6-10 staff, multi-location |

**Why higher pricing works:**
- ROI example: Solo lash tech paying Fresha £6,288/year
- Your £2,495 solution pays for itself in **4.7 months**
- After that, £6,288/year stays in their pocket, forever
- Fresha fees compound annually (£31,440 over 5 years)
- Your solution: one-time cost

**Positioning Discovered:**

> "The Fresha Fee Eliminator for UK Beauty Professionals. Stop paying £6,000-£18,000/year to Fresha. Get your own custom booking system, built in 7 days. Own your clients. Own your data. Pay once, use forever."

**Key Positioning Elements:**
- "Fresha Fee Eliminator" (direct attack on main competitor)
- Specific numbers (£6k-18k/year pain)
- Speed (7 days)
- Ownership ("own your clients, own your data")
- One-time payment ("pay once, use forever" vs SaaS rental)

**Market Gap Identified:**
- No one positioned as "Fresha fee eliminator"
- Pricing sweet spot £2k-5k is wide open
- No "done in 7 days" offering exists
- Speed + ownership angle untapped

**Distribution Channels:**
- **SING Facebook Group:** 16,000 UK beauty professionals (primary channel)
- **Salon Geek Forum:** Active community
- **Industry events:** Professional Beauty London, Olympia Beauty
- **Instagram:** #ukbeauty, #lashtech, #beautytech hashtags

**Next Steps (Week 1-2):**
1. Join SING Facebook group (16k members) + Salon Geek forum
2. Update Fresha Fee Calculator (show £6k-18k range, not £4k)
3. Offer 1-2 lash techs "founder pricing" (£1,500-2,000) for case studies

- Validation score: 41/50 (strongest of all researched niches)
- Rochelle has 4 warm leads ready
- Clear pain point: £6k-18k/year Fresha fees
- Accessible: SING group (16k members)
- Can get 2-3 case studies in 4-6 weeks

**2. Pricing Strategy Revised**
- Original: £1k/£2k/£3k (too low based on research)
- New: £2,495/£3,995/£6,495 (supported by ROI data)
- Rationale: Fresha fees are £6k-18k/year, solution pays for itself in <6 months
- Payment flexibility: Can offer £625-1,625/month × 4 for cash flow concerns

**3. Positioning: "Fresha Fee Eliminator"**
- Direct attack positioning (vs generic "booking automation")
- Speaks to #1 pain point (fees)
- Clear differentiation (ownership vs rental, one-time vs recurring)
- Speed promise (7 days)
- Emotional appeal ("own your clients, own your data")

**4. Trust Strategy**
- Start with Rochelle's warm intros (trust transfer)
- Offer founder pricing for first 2: £1,500-2,000 (vs £2,495)
- Get video testimonials + case studies
- Then use calculator for cold lead gen (low trust, self-serve)

**5. Following EP Methods (Not Inventing New Ones)**
- Use proven 5-dimension validation (not gut feel)
- Outcome-focused copy (EP Module 4 principles)
- Proof hierarchy (lead with results, Tier 1)
- Authority building through education (calculator as lead magnet)
