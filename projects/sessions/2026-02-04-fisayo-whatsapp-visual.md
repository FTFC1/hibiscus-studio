# Session Packet: Fisayo WhatsApp Visual (EP Research + Design)

**Session Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** ~2.5h
**Work Type:** Implementation + Research

---

## CONTEXT

Fisayo hasn't gotten back with the 7 referrals. User realized: "He needs something high-quality to send that makes HIM look good (high design bar)."

Initial assets created (partner briefs) were wrong audience - pitched to end-users (downtime costs, service vehicles) when Fisayo's contacts are developers/architects building NEW projects (they don't have generators yet to fail).

**User received EP validation research** in zip file "Second Round Complexity" with 4 analyses validating strategy, but fact-checking revealed some claims needed correction.

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Target Audience Correction (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Fisayo's 7 contacts are developers/architects with building projects in pipeline, NOT end-users with failing generators

**Why:**
- They're building estates, commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities
- They need generators AS PART of construction, not replacements for existing ones
- Asking "How many days did YOU lose to downtime?" makes no sense (they don't own generators yet)

**Impact:**
- Complete messaging pivot
- Removed: downtime costs, service vehicles, TCO savings over 5 years
- Added: project timeline, sizing accuracy, no callbacks after handover, budget certainty

**Before/After:**
- ❌ OLD: "How many days did YOU lose to generator failures last year?"
- ✅ NEW: "10-day delivery doesn't delay your construction timeline"

---

### 2. Remove Unverified EP Claims (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Strip out 3 unverified claims from sales materials after fact-check

**Why:** User provided fact-check showing:
- ❌ "B2B generators 70-80% referral-driven in Nigeria" - No Nigeria-specific evidence (only general B2B stats)
- ❌ "Downtime is 44% of total cost" - Appears nowhere in TCO literature
- ❌ "Mikano reduces downtime 60-70%" - No comparative data exists

**Verified claims to USE:**
- ✅ 84% of B2B buyers start with referrals (general, not Nigeria-specific)
- ✅ Nigerian businesses lose 56 days/year to outages (verified)
- ✅ Mikano has 220+ service vehicles, 400+ staff (verified infrastructure)
- ✅ 5-6% of annual revenue lost to power issues (verified)

**Impact:**
- More credible sales approach
- Can't be fact-checked and found false
- Still strong value proposition without BS percentages

---

### 3. Visual Format = WhatsApp-Optimized (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Create single-page HTML card (540px width) optimized for WhatsApp screenshot/PDF sharing

**Why:**
- Fisayo needs something he can quickly share
- Screenshot works in WhatsApp preview
- Can also convert to PDF and attach
- All info visible without clicking/scrolling too much

**Impact:**
- Fisayo can send in <1 minute
- Makes him look professional/sophisticated
- Recipients see everything at a glance

---

### 4. Mikano Brand Colors = Red/Brown (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Use red/brown gradients (#7f1d1d, #991b1b) instead of green

**Why:** Green was placeholder, Mikano's actual brand is red/brown

**Impact:**
- On-brand visual
- Professional appearance

---

### 5. Remove Fisayo's Intro from Visual (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Visual card has NO personal message from Fisayo - just Mikano info

**Why:**
- User feedback: "Remove 'Hi, my name is Fisayo...' section"
- Fisayo writes his own intro message when sending
- Visual is just the info card he attaches

**Impact:**
- Cleaner design
- Fisayo can customize intro per contact
- Visual is reusable for all 7 referrals

---

### 6. SVG Icons (Not Emojis) (MINOR)

**Decision:** Use high-quality SVG line icons for project types

**Why:** User feedback: "It shouldn't have emojis, it should have high quality icons"

**Impact:**
- Professional appearance
- Scales perfectly (vector)
- Matches Mikano brand quality

---

### 7. Separate MTU Gas and Perkins Diesel (MINOR)

**Decision:** Show as two distinct generator types with clear specs

**Before:** "MTU Gas + Perkins Diesel — German/UK engines, 15kVA–2500kVA"

**After:**
```
MTU Gas              Perkins Diesel
German Engineering   UK Manufacturing
1MW – 2.5MW         15kVA – 1000kVA
```

**Why:** User feedback: "MTU is gas, then separately we have diesel. That needs to be clearer."

**Impact:** No confusion about what's gas vs diesel

---

### 8. Clarify "Free Technical Support" (MINOR)

**Decision:** Specify what "free technical support" includes

**Before:** "Free technical support"

**After:** "Free technical support (load calculations, MEP coordination)"

**Why:** User asked: "Is it free technical support or is it free site visit?"

**Impact:** Clear what the free support covers (site visit leads to load calculations)

---

## OPEN ITEMS

### 1. Fill Fisayo's WhatsApp Number

**Location:** Line 337 in `fisayo-whatsapp-visual-v2.html`

**Current:** `https://wa.me/[FISAYO_NUMBER]?text=...`

**Action:** Replace `[FISAYO_NUMBER]` with his actual number (format: 2348012345678)

**Why:** Makes "Message Fisayo" button clickable

---

### 2. Revise Internal Sales Brief (If Needed)

**File:** `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/fisayo-referral-sales-brief.html`

**Issue:** Built using unverified EP claims (44% downtime, 60-70% reduction)

**Action:** Review and update with verified claims only

**Why:** Internal use only, but should be honest like external materials

---

## META

### Pattern Observed

**EP's core insight:** You don't need bullshit percentages when the verified facts are this strong.

**The facts:**
- 56 days/year lost to outages (verified)
- ₦676.6B spent in 6 months by manufacturers (verified)
- 220 service vehicles + 30 mobile units (verified)
- 30 years in Nigeria + NNPC credential (verified)

**The question isn't:** "Can we prove 60-70% reduction?"

**The question is:** "Can Fisayo's contacts afford to specify unreliable generators and have their clients call them complaining after handover?"

That's reputation protection, not TCO calculations.

---

### Lesson Learned

**Audience targeting is everything.**

Initial briefs pitched:
- "How many days did YOU lose to downtime?"
- "Service vehicles = faster recovery"
- "TCO savings over 5 years"

But Fisayo's contacts are building NEW projects. They haven't lost days to downtime. They don't call service vehicles. They're not calculating 5-year TCO.

**They care about:**
- "Will this delay my construction timeline?" (10-day delivery)
- "Will I get sizing wrong?" (free load calculations)
- "Will my clients call me complaining?" (30-year track record, NNPC)
- "Will I blow my budget?" (competitive pricing, clear quotes)

**Same product, completely different pitch.**

---

### EP Application

User asked: "How would /ep approach this instead?"

**EP's honest approach:**
1. Strip unverified claims (44%, 60-70%)
2. Lead with verified pain (56 days/year, ₦676.6B spent)
3. Discovery questions first ("How many days did you lose last year?")
4. Build TCO with THEIR data (not generic assumptions)
5. Risk reversal ("Let's measure together over 6 months")
6. Honest positioning ("Here's what we know we have vs what we don't know yet")

**Result:** More persuasive than BS percentages because it's measurable and honest.
