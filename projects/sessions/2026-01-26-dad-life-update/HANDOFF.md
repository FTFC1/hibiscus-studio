## SESSION OVERVIEW

## EXTRACTION RESULTS

### HARD FACTS CAPTURED

**Mikano Power:**
- Lost factory bid: N252m/month vs N184m/month (27% gap)
- New opportunity: 250kVA residential, Ikoyi - site visit next week
- Client had death in family (someone user knows)
- Gas partnership: Putting together proposal to connect parties (early stage)

**London Business Work:**
- Removed invoicing cost for one business
- Operational systems work

**Other Opportunities:**
- AI art commission from Nigerian client (next 2 weeks)
- British clothing brand: Inventory cleared, setting up wholesale + social selling + e-commerce

**Personal:**
- Saw Feyi (youngest brother, just came back)
- Helping him with creative direction
- Dad knows Feyi is back, doesn't know user is helping

## DAD CONTEXT (For future reference)

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Age | 60, Nigerian, ex-politician |
| Title | Yoruba titled man |
| Recent event | Opened club that failed to launch early December |
| Family position | User is eldest of 5 |
| Relationship | Fell out previously - user doesn't comply, neuro + UK upbringing |
| Living history | Never lived together until user was 28 in Nigeria |
| Response style | Concise, achievements, bullet points, numbers |
| London work view | Neutral-to-good |

### Communication constraints:
- Phone calls trigger user, derail work
- Transparency desired but not too much detail
- No promises to call (won't keep them)
- Don't invite follow-up questions about Feyi

---

## COMMUNICATION PATTERN (Reusable)

**Structure:** Good / Bad / Ugly

**Opening:** "E kaasan Baba mi" (Yoruba greeting)

**Closing:** "Baba mi" (respectful)

**Tone rules:**
- Factual, adult-to-adult
- No apologies for silence
- No excuses
- Achievements over explanations
- Concise bullets, not paragraphs

**Example final message:**
```
E kaasan Baba mi,

THE GOOD
- New power deal: 250kVA residential, Ikoyi - site visit next week
- Gas partnership: Putting together proposal to connect parties (early stage)
- Removed invoicing cost for London business
- AI art commission - Nigerian client (next 2 weeks)
- British clothing brand: Inventory cleared, now setting up wholesale + social selling + e-commerce
- Feyi: helping him with creative direction

THE BAD
- Lost factory bid: N252m/month vs N184m/month - gap too wide

THE UGLY
- I know I've been quiet. Not an excuse, just letting you know what I'm working on.

Hope the club is settling in.

Baba mi
```

**Response:** Positive - dad sent pic of himself on jet + details

**Weekend event:**
- 60th birthday party at dad's club
- Celebrant = user's old boss + dad's good friend

- Dad had already left by time user arrived

**Follow-up action taken:**
- Sent video of user + celebrant smiling/laughing
- No additional message needed
- Relationship managed ✓

## DECISIONS MADE THIS SESSION

| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Good/Bad/Ugly structure | Government person, scans quickly |
| No apology for 2-week silence | Would sound like excuse, not helpful |
| No promise to call | User can't keep it, would make things worse |
| Video of celebrant sufficient | Shows presence, connection to dad's circle |
| Don't over-manage now | Message sent, video sent, let it rest |

## PROCESS LESSONS

**What worked:**
1. Interview-first to understand dad's response patterns
2. Extraction to separate facts from emotional context
3. Iterative refinement based on user corrections
4. User correcting technical details (N252m/month, Ikoyi not Akoi, etc.)

**Mistakes corrected:**
1. "Akoi" → "Ikoyi"
2. Conflated gas and power deals
3. Too wordy initial draft
4. "Exploring launch" → "Inventory cleared, setting up" (much further along)
5. "Side projects" → specific achievement (removed invoicing cost)
