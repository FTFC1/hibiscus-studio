## 🎯 Quick Summary

**The Problem:**
- Call center receives ~3 leads/day, hands to salespeople
- When sales happen, ZERO attribution to call center
- Salespeople claim hotline leads as "outside leads"
- Call center gets ₦0 commission

**The Proof:**
- Matched phone numbers across 3 data sources
- Found 9 confirmed conversions = ₦528M revenue
- 100% phone match accuracy (names changed, phones didn't)
- From limited 3-month sample (full year = 3-4x more)

**The Solution:**
- 0.1% commission for call center (₦528k for these 9 sales)
- Salesperson keeps 7.5% (they lose nothing)
- Company pays additional 0.1% from margin
- Monthly automated matching prevents gaming

**The Defense:**
- Remove gaming incentive (salesperson commission unchanged)
- Multi-source phone verification (5+ data sources)
- Penalties for fraud (suspension → termination)
- Head of Operations adjudicates disputes
