# Session Packet: Generator Sales Strategy Pivot (Nigerian Reality Check)

**Session Date:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (Strategy defined, execution starts this week)
**Duration:** ~2.5h
**Work Type:** Strategic planning → Operational reality check

---

## CONTEXT

**Starting Point:**
- LinkedIn analysis showed MEP consultants reply at 3.7x rate vs procurement (25% vs 6.8%)
- Initial strategy: "Target MEP consulting firms (node strategy) via trigger monitoring"
- Assumed triggers are findable via RSS/LinkedIn monitoring (Western SaaS playbook)

**Reality Check (User Feedback):**
- Nigerian triggers are PRIVATE (pastor gets funding, gen stolen, inside deals)
- LinkedIn doesn't cover market (Chinese industrial parks, local businesses)
- Media is controlled/censored ("need to read between the lines")
- Existing Mikano network blocked (family relationship issues, sales team protective)
- Most deals happen via government connections + personal relationships

**Key Quote:**
> "You're never going to know [triggers]... this could be a pastor at church, real estate developer who just got funding, someone whose gen was stolen, facility near gas pipeline. You're not going to find this on RSS feeds."

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. ABANDON Trigger Monitoring via RSS/LinkedIn (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Stop building trigger monitoring systems (Google Alerts, Inoreader, LinkedIn automation)

**Why:**
- Nigerian triggers are private/unknowable via public data sources
- Examples: Pastor gets funding (no announcement), gen stolen (not newsworthy), inside deals (won't appear online)
- LinkedIn doesn't cover market (Chinese industrial parks, local buyers don't use Western platforms)
- Media is censored ("have to approve what they post") → delays, bias, gaps

**Impact:**
- 8 implementation guides created (bookmarklet, alerts dashboard, etc.) are now DEPRIORITIZED
- Focus shifts from "find triggers yourself" to "build network that tells you about triggers"

**Alternative Approach:**
- Referral engine (people tell you about triggers)
- Authority/inbound (they find you when triggered)
- Physical presence (hear triggers in conversation)
- Strategic partnerships (piggyback on deal flow)

---

### 2. ADOPT Referral Network Model (Fisayo Example) (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Build "stupidly easy" referral program for architects, developers, MEP consultants

**Why:**
- User called architect (Fisayo) → Within 2 minutes, 7 referrals lined up
- Fisayo has deal flow (projects in pipeline)
- Commission incentive works: ₦500K-₦1M per closed deal
- Warm intros (Fisayo asks permission for numbers, not cold outreach)
- This is PROVEN model (Casa 45 = father's club, Tempo = family friend lawyer)

**Impact:**
- Shifts strategy from "cold LinkedIn outreach" to "recruit referral partners with deal flow"
- Commission structure becomes competitive advantage (vs trying to undercut on price)

**Execution:**
1. Create one-page referral PDF (₦500K-₦1M commission, priority pricing, technical support)
2. Convert Fisayo's 7 referrals this week (proof of concept)
3. Recruit 10 more "Fisayos" (architects, developers, PMs, MEP consultants, equipment brokers)

---

### 3. VALIDATE Instagram as Authority Channel (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Test Instagram as "generator expert" positioning (not just delivery posts)

**Why:**
- User insight: "Nigerians love social media. They really do."
- Competitor example: "Only Diesel Generator" (4k followers, posts deliveries, BAD engagement, ignores DMs)
- Opportunity: Educational/technical content + engagement could differentiate

**Strategy:**
- 3x/week posts (Mon: Educational, Wed: Case study, Fri: Industry insight)
- Reply to EVERY comment/DM within 24h (unlike competitors)
- CTA: "DM 'SIZING' for calculator" (not "buy from us")
- Goal: Become the person people find when they need generator info

**Success Criteria (Week 1):**
- 3 posts published
- >10% engagement rate (comments/shares)
- 2+ DM inquiries

---

### 4. DEPRIORITIZE Direct Sales to Operations (MINOR)

**Decision:** Don't focus on "Head of Operations at end customers" as primary target

**Why:**
- User already tested procurement (6.8% reply, 1 meeting, 0 deals)
- Direct operations likely has same lock-in problem (existing vendor relationships)
- Price undercutting is common (Tempo deal lost to 27% undercut)
- Without trigger/warm intro, cold pitch annoys recipients

**Exception:**
- IF referral partner introduces you to operations person (warm intro)
- THEN pitch with case study/ROI (not cold "diesel costs killing you")

---

## RESEARCH CONDUCTED (MISSING FROM ORIGINAL)

### Mar&Mor LinkedIn Company Research (Live Example)
**User demonstrated actual research workflow:**
- Found Mar&Mor Engineering Services Ltd (265 employees)
- Filtered by Nigeria location → 243 employees shown
- **UI Quirk Discovered:** "Nigeria" filter doesn't include Lagos State automatically
  - Had to add Nigeria + Lagos State + Lagos + Abuja separately
  - Screenshot evidence of this quirk
- Searched "MEP" within company → 48 people found
- Reviewed profiles: Senior PM, Head of MEP Design, Electrical Design Engineer
- **Observation:** Most people just repost company content, low original activity
- **Profile quality signals noted:**
  - Professional photo = more senior/engaged
  - No photo = either very senior OR very junior
  - LinkedIn activity = proxy for engagement (accepting connections > posting)

**Key Insight:** Company-first targeting is better than person-first
- Small TAM (Nigeria) → Can't waste companies
- Multiple contacts per company (MEP + Procurement + Ops) = higher conversion
- User quote: "For each company we find, we want to find many people"

### Old LinkedIn Profile Scoring System (User Reference)
- User mentioned having old Perplexity prompt for scoring LinkedIn profiles
- Used Perplexity comment browser (AI inside tool to analyze pages)
- Showed example output (scoring system for prospects)
- Note: System is old, but demonstrates user's prior sophistication in lead qualification

---

## WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. Master Review v2 HTML
**File:** `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 2/analysis/MASTER-REVIEW-V2.html`

**Contents:**
- Section 1: Priority Clarification (ICP research > bookmarklet automation)
- Section 2: Research Automation Logic (20 min → 10 min explanation)
- Section 3: Alerts Dashboard Visual (Inoreader mockup, setup guide)
- Section 4: Triggers v2 Changes (A→B comparison, why "new facility" removed)
- Section 5: File Locations (quick access to all 17 files)

**Purpose:** Explain the "WHY" behind each recommendation (user requested after reviewing first Master Review)

---

### 2. Mikano Professional Partnership Brief (No Commission Version)
**Files:**
- `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 2/analysis/mikano-partner-brief.md`
- `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 2/analysis/mikano-partner-brief.html` (PDF-ready, opened in browser)

**Purpose:** Professional one-pager for architects/developers that focuses on value WITHOUT explicit commission mention (Nigerian business culture - commission discussed verbally, not in writing)

**Contents:**
- What Mikano provides (MTU gas, Perkins diesel, 3-4 week delivery)
- Why partner (30 years, preferential pricing, technical support)
- How it works (3-step process)
- Ideal projects (estates, commercial, manufacturing)
- Technical capabilities
- Client testimonials
- Contact info (placeholders for user to fill)

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ "Preferential pricing for projects introduced by professional partners" (implicit value)
- ✅ Print-friendly styling (page breaks, professional layout)
- ❌ NO explicit commission mention (₦500K-₦1M discussed in person)

**Distribution Plan:** Send to Fisayo's 7 referrals this week via WhatsApp/email

---

### 3. Updated HUD (data.js)
**File:** `/projects/hud/data.js`

**Changes:**
- `doNext`: Updated from stale "9am" to "Build MEP lead list via research (10 prospects)"
- `wins`: Added LinkedIn analysis (3.7x MEP reply rate, 17 files delivered)
- `active`: Updated GAS track → "Analysis ✓ → Now: Build lead list via research"
- `shipped`: Added LinkedIn analysis outputs (HUD, 8 guides, Nigerian templates)
- `lastUpdated`: 2026-02-02T17:15:00

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

### 1. CLAUDE.md (2 new patterns)
**File:** `/Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/trellomcp/trello-mcp/CLAUDE.md`

**Added:**
- **HUD Updates: data.js Pattern** → Never regenerate full HTML, update data.js only (saves 5-10k tokens)
- **Terminal + Browser Layout Pattern** → Keep terminal (right) + browser (left), use `open` command proactively

**Why:** User frustrated with stale HUD + files not opened in browser

---

### 2. QUICK-START.md (Priority Correction)
**Context:** Original QUICK-START emphasized bookmarklet as TODAY priority

**Correction (via conversation, not file edit):**
- Bookmarklet = optional automation (reduces CRM friction)
- Actual priority = ICP research → Lead list → Profiles → Automation
- User quote: "Isn't it to define my ICP via research so we can build a lead list?"

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- ✅ **Honest assessment of what won't work:** Trigger monitoring, cold LinkedIn, MEP node strategy (without network access)
- ✅ **Identified proven model:** Referral engine (Fisayo example = 7 referrals in 2 min call)
- ✅ **Commission structure validated:** ₦500K-₦1M per deal "would work and be way easier"
- ✅ **Instagram opportunity identified:** Nigerians love social media, competitors have bad engagement

### Foundational
- ✅ **Strategy aligned with Nigerian reality:** Private triggers, relationship-driven, media censorship
- ✅ **Understanding of what user ACTUALLY has:** Mikano brand (30 years), product availability, hustle, time to build
- ✅ **Understanding of what user DOESN'T have:** Government connections, family network access, existing customer intros, sales team cooperation
- ✅ **Clear Week 1 actions:** Fisayo's 7 referrals, referral PDF, Instagram content, recruit 10 more referral partners

---

---

## CONSTRAINTS IDENTIFIED (DETAILED)

### What User DOESN'T Have:

**1. Government Connections (CRITICAL)**
- Most Mikano deals happen via government connections ("quiet stuff online won't show")
- Mikano owned by "non-Nigerian family with very good connections in Nigeria"
- User doesn't have these connections

**2. Family Network Access (BLOCKED)**
- User brought to Nigeria by family member
- Relationship "not good" now
- User quote: "Me asking for help is just going to lead to more of the problem that made me take a step back"
- Can't leverage Mikano's 30-year relationship network

**3. Existing Customer Referrals (BLOCKED)**
- Sales team protective ("don't want someone stealing customers")
- Won't share customer information
- User has no access to previous deal information
- "Has to build it myself"

**4. Competitor Pricing (LOSING ON PRICE)**
- Mikano is expensive (not cheapest on market)
- Can get "decent discount" due to family relationship
- But still can't compete on price
- **Example:** Tempo deal lost to incumbent who undercut by 27%

**5. Inside Deal Intel**
- Construction permits filed (already inside deals in Nigeria)
- Early project announcements (private until public launch)
- Trigger events (happen privately, not announced)

### What User DOES Have:

**1. Mikano Brand (30+ Years)**
- Established 1994
- Well-known in Nigeria
- Direct OEM partnerships (MTU Germany, Perkins UK, FG Wilson)
- BUT: Expensive positioning (quality/reliability, not cheapest)

**2. Product Availability**
- MTU gas generators (380kVA-2.5MW)
- Perkins/FG Wilson diesel (380kVA-2.5MW)
- 3-4 week delivery vs 8-12 week imports
- Competitive advantage on speed

**3. Technical Knowledge**
- Diesel vs gas economics
- Generator sizing for different applications
- ROI calculations
- MEP coordination requirements

**4. Hustle & Persistence**
- Willing to try new approaches
- Not giving up despite constraints
- Ran LinkedIn campaign (91 leads)
- Actively researching (Mar&Mor example)

**5. Time to Build**
- Not expecting overnight results
- Willing to test and iterate
- Week 1 mindset (proof of concept)

**6. One Proven Relationship**
- Fisayo (architect) → 7 referrals in 2-minute call
- Demonstrates model works
- Need to replicate with 10 more "Fisayos"

**7. Two Deal History (Learning Points)**
- **Casa 45 (club):** User's father owns it → Deal closed
- **Tempo (manufacturing, Ogun):** Family friend lawyer intro → Lost to 27% undercut

---

## FAILED APPROACHES (DETAILED)

**User tried these BEFORE referral model, all failed:**

### 1. Equipment Dealers/Maintenance Partners
- **Attempt:** Messaged "Only Diesel Generator" on Instagram (4k followers, posts deliveries)
- **Result:** Completely ignored
- **User observation:** "They have bad engagement, continue to post, but it's a bit annoying"

### 2. Real Estate Contact (Referral Attempt)
- **Attempt:** Approached someone in real estate about referral partnership
- **Response:** "Do you have something written?" "Do you have something I can share?"
- **Result:** Never followed up
- **User insight:** "People aren't very switched on... don't think 'I can make money if I just do this.' Even with commission, they don't do it because people aren't focused."

### 3. Industry Events
- **Attempt:** Attend industry events (manufacturers, energy, construction)
- **Result:** "Not particularly fruitful. Mostly competitors. People there trying to get business."
- **Company stance:** Won't invest in stands/sponsorships ("don't see value")
- **User observation:** "Lots of posturing, attractive women to get people in, but not fruitful"

### 4. Site Visits (Industrial Parks)
- **Attempt:** Walk into industrial parks to find prospects
- **Result:** "They won't let you in. Private land. They'll say 'who are you, go away.'"
- **Reality check:** Can't just show up and ask "who's the decision maker"

### 5. Bank Partnership (Zenith Bank)
- **Attempt:** Asset financing partnership to get deal flow
- **Reality:** "Someone brings them a quote they've already got [from vendor]. Too late."
- **Problem:** Financing happens AFTER vendor selection, not before
- **Conclusion:** Banks don't help source deals, they finance completed decisions

---

## PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: "Western Playbook ≠ Nigerian Reality"
**Observation:**
- LinkedIn monitoring → Works in US/Europe (public job changes, press releases)
- Doesn't work in Nigeria (Chinese buyers don't use LinkedIn, triggers are private, media censored)

**Lesson:** Always stress-test strategy against local market reality before building

---

### Pattern 2: "Reply Rate ≠ Conversion Rate"
**Observation:**
- MEP consultants: 25% reply rate (3.7x better than procurement)
- But: 15 replies from original 91 leads → 0 deals closed
- Vanity metric if none convert

**Lesson:** Track full funnel (reply → conversation → meeting → proposal → deal), not just top of funnel

---

### Pattern 3: "People Know People (Referral Beats Cold Outreach)"
**Observation:**
- Cold LinkedIn → Ignored (tried "Only Diesel Generator" DM, no response)
- Cold industry events → "Not fruitful, mostly competitors"
- Warm intro (Fisayo) → 7 referrals in 2 minutes

**Lesson:** In relationship-driven markets, network access > lead volume

---

### Pattern 4: "Commission Makes Referrals Worth It"
**Observation:**
- Real estate contact: "Do you have something written?" → Never followed up
- Fisayo: ₦500K-₦1M commission → "Would work and be way easier"

**Commission Structure Evolution:**
1. Initial: ₦500K per deal
2. User corrected: "₦500K to ₦1M per deal" (size-based)
3. User reaction: "It would work and be way easier"

**Lesson:** Incentive needs to be HIGH ENOUGH to overcome "people aren't focused" problem

---

### Pattern 5: "Commission NOT in Writing (Nigerian Culture)"
**Observation:**
- User specifically requested one-pager that DOESN'T mention commission
- Commission discussed verbally in private conversations
- Written materials focus on "preferential pricing" and "professional partnership"

**Lesson:** Nigerian business culture = commission is discussed in person, not documented

---

## META

### What Went Well:
- ✅ User challenged assumptions hard ("Does this make sense? Stress test this logic.")
- ✅ Real example (Fisayo call) validated referral model immediately
- ✅ Honest about constraints (no family network, no government connections)
- ✅ Willing to pivot strategy multiple times (trigger monitoring → referral engine)

### What Could Improve:
- ⚠️ Initial strategy (trigger monitoring, MEP node) didn't account for Nigerian market reality
- ⚠️ Should have asked "How do Mikano deals actually close?" earlier in conversation
- ⚠️ Assumed user had network access (existing customers, sales team cooperation)

### Process Improvement:
- **Before building strategy:** Ask "What constraints do you have?" and "What has worked before?"
- **Don't assume Western/SaaS playbooks work in other markets:** Stress-test against local reality
- **Validate with real examples:** Fisayo call > theoretical framework

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Fisayo's 7 referrals:** Track conversion (2+ qualified = proof of concept)
2. **Referral PDF:** Get user approval on content, commission structure
3. **Instagram posts:** Review Week 1 content, engagement metrics
4. **EP Learning review:** User shares path, extract applicable frameworks
5. **Recruit next 10 "Fisayos":** Message templates, outreach channels

---

## FISAYO CALL TRANSCRIPT (LIVE, MID-CONVERSATION)

**Context:** User called Fisayo (architect) during our session to follow up on promised intro

**Key Moments:**
```
User: "How are you? I'm still chasing you because I want to... we were supposed to have that meeting with the guy you said was out of town."

Fisayo: "Yeah, he's still not back."

User: "Do you think there's other people worth talking to? I'm trying to decide right now because it's New Month and I'm trying to think to myself, am I really going to try and do the networking part? Or is it going to take some time to build your network?"

Fisayo: "Yes, it will take time."

User: "I'll follow up with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] people. I'll ask them if I can give you their number."

User (after call): "Fisayo will ask permission for their numbers. I'll follow up with 7 people."
```

**User's Filter (Internal Monologue During Call):**
> "If they have things in their pipeline, they can get a higher discount and quality items. But if they're just like 'I just want someone I can ask to do random stuff for me,' there's no point."

**Outcome:**
- 7 referrals lined up
- Fisayo will ask permission for numbers
- User will only engage if they have "things in pipeline" (active projects)
- Proof of concept for referral model
