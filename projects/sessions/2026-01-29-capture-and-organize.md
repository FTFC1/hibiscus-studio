## Key Intel Extracted

### From WhatsApp T001 (Timi/PUMA)
- Selar Pro activated (₦12k/month)
- Course: 4 modules, 24 missions, 6 weeks
- Timi wants Telegram demo (not just PDF)
- Need Adedolapo sign-off before rollout
- PUMA 3-size rule: requested + 1 bigger + 1 smaller

### From Telegram (Rochelle/HB) - Complete
- **Salary Commitment:** "Revenue is coming in, January and you would have that"
- **90% Complete:** Rochelle happy with progress
- **Feature Requests:** Visual package tiers, half-day/full-day booking, customer portal
- **Advanced Vision:** Check-in/check-out with auto overtime charging
- **Deferred:** Flower Girl workshops (reduce scope)
- **Key Quote:** "I don't care what anyone else has to say about you. I just care about what I have to say"

---

## PUMA Architecture Decision (Discussed)

**User concern:** "If I lose anything, what does it sit on?"

**Recommended hybrid:**
- Selar for course shell + payment
- Telegram bot for interactive missions
- Google Sheets as data backbone
- You own all data, platform-agnostic

---

## Plan.md Status

Located: `/00_Inbox/jan 29/Plan.md` (Jan 28 meta-analysis)
**Needs update** with:
- HB booking funnel shipped (not just "demo")
- Selar Pro activated
- Playwright > Cursor discovery
- New workstation setup (HUD + terminal)
- Rochelle salary/revenue context

---

3. [ ] Update Plan.md with today's learnings
4. [ ] Build PUMA visual presentation (Selar dashboard with demo data)
5. [ ] Review PUMA Excel for hero products
6. [ ] HB: Add half-day/full-day to booking funnel
7. [ ] HB: Build customer portal (cancel/reschedule)
8. [ ] Optional: Scrape themix.ng for product images

## PUMA Demo Strategy (Late Session Update)

**Approach changed:** NO interactive Telegram bot initially

**What to build:**
- Visual presentation showing the whole experience
- Dashboard view, how staff enter, what lessons look like
- Sell the image first

**Telegram delivery:**
- Manual posting ("manual bot")
- Just paste content on schedule
- No interactions (would become annoying)
- Human posts, validates concept before automation

**Rationale:** Almost built anyway, can show interactivity. Sell the image, then build automation once they buy in.

- `/00_Inbox/jan 29/Plan.md` — meta-analysis (needs update)

## Context Retention Notes

- User prefers HUD over HD (visual dashboards)
- "seea" = "see attached" (logged in CLAUDE.md)
- Tool inventory enables cross-discipline serendipity
- Playwright works better in terminal than Cursor
- New workstation: static HUD browser + terminal side by side
