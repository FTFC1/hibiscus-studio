# Session Packet: Partner Brief Rewrite + Follow-Up Process

**Session Date:** 2026-02-03
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** ~1.5h
**Work Type:** implementation

---

## CONTEXT

Fisayo has 7 referrals lined up. Before he can share the partner brief, we needed to:
1. Rewrite the existing brief properly (fix issues, update messaging)
2. Define the follow-up process (what happens AFTER they read the brief)

User: "We need to spend a lot of time writing that [partner brief] properly."

From Feb 2 session packet: Referral model validated (Fisayo call = 7 referrals in 2 min). Commission structure locked in (₦500K-₦2M per deal, verbal). One-pager existed but needed fixes.

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Speed Messaging Update (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Emphasize 48-hour site visits + stock availability for faster delivery

**Why:**
- User clarified: "Site visit within 48 hours" (not just proposal)
- Stock available = "very very quickly" (less than 3-4 weeks standard)
- Speed is competitive advantage

**Impact:** Partner brief now highlights response speed, not just delivery time

**Location:** `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/mikano-partner-brief-v2.md` (lines 13-14)

---

### 2. Commission Structure (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Keep commission verbal (not in writing), update to ₦500K-₦2M range

**Why:**
- Nigerian business culture: Commission discussed in person, not documented
- User correction: "Actually ₦500K-₦2M (size-based, can go higher)"
- Brief says "preferential pricing" (implicit, correct for culture)

**Impact:** Brief doesn't mention commission directly, keeps cultural appropriateness

**Location:** Planning discussion, not in brief itself

---

### 3. Call to Discuss Partnership (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** CTA = "15-minute introductory call" (not immediate referral)

**Why:**
- Pricing changes week to week (forex, OEM pricing)
- Discounts depend on specific situation (management unlocks case-by-case)
- Answers questions faster than email back-and-forth
- User: "Nigerians will call anyway ('got your details from this person')"

**Impact:** Sets expectation for qualification call before referral relationship starts

**Location:** `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/mikano-partner-brief-v2.md` (lines 108-122)

---

### 4. Ease of Process Emphasis (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Add "You Introduce, We Do Everything Else" section

**Why:**
- Makes partnership stupidly easy (partner just introduces, no work required)
- User's value prop: "You maintain the relationship, we handle the execution"
- Reduces friction for partners with no technical knowledge

**Impact:** Brief now highlights low effort required from partner

**Location:** `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/mikano-partner-brief-v2.md` (lines 33-37, highlight box in HTML)

---

### 5. British English + Remove Made-Up Content (MINOR)

**Decision:**
- British English throughout (customised, synchronised, centres, programmes)
- Remove training line (Mikano doesn't usually do facility management training)
- Remove testimonials (made-up quotes not appropriate)

**Why:** User corrections for accuracy and professionalism

**Impact:** Brief is accurate and culturally appropriate for Nigerian business context

**Location:** Multiple locations in both MD and HTML versions

## WHAT WAS CREATED

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/mikano-partner-brief-v2.md` | Rewritten partner brief (British English, speed emphasis, ease messaging) |
| `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/mikano-partner-brief-v2.html` | Print-ready HTML version (professional format, ready to distribute) |
| `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/qualification-call-script.md` | 6-question script to assess if partner has pipeline + influence |
| `/projects/00_Inbox/Feb 3/initial-followup.md` | Message template for follow-up after brief is shared |

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

None (all new files for this session)

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- Partner brief ready to distribute to Fisayo's 7 referrals
- Follow-up process defined (qualification call script + initial message)
- HTML version ready to print/PDF for professional distribution
- Clear CTA: "Call to discuss partnership" (sets expectation)

### Foundational
- Qualification script filters partners with no pipeline/influence
- Reusable process for recruiting 10 more partners (Week 2)
- Cultural appropriateness validated (commission verbal, call instead of email)
- Speed messaging differentiated vs competitors (48h site visit, stock availability)

---

## OPEN ITEMS

### 1. Fill Contact Placeholders
**Action:** Replace [Your Name], [Your Number], [Your Email] in both MD and HTML versions

**Blocker:** None, just needs user to fill in

---

### 2. Test with Fisayo's First Referral
**Action:** When Fisayo sends first intro, use qualification script

**What to test:**
- Do the 6 questions reveal pipeline + influence?
- Does the script filter out "I just have one project" people?
- Does initial follow-up message get calls scheduled?

**Timeline:** When Fisayo completes his permission calls

---

## META

**Pattern observed:** Planning mode works well when user clarifies scope ("we need to spend time writing that properly"). Exploration → Questions → Rewrite was efficient.

**Lesson:** Ask about existing content issues BEFORE rewriting. User caught: made-up testimonials, American English, missing speed messaging. Asking first prevented multiple rewrites.

**User correction velocity:** Fast feedback cycle (5 corrections in one message) meant one rewrite was enough. Good signal that user knew exactly what was wrong.
