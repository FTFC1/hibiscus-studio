# Session Packet: Friday Exports — Context Loading & Tool Landscape

**Session Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (HBS export processing next)
**Duration:** ~2.5h
**Work Type:** Research, infrastructure, exploration

---

## CONTEXT

Saturday session. User delivered a ~30-minute voice note covering everything from HB Studio workshop strategy to AI creative tools to infrastructure needs. This was a context-loading session — capturing ideas, evaluating tools, connecting dots across multiple projects before prioritizing.

Voice note processed through multiple correction rounds (mistranscriptions, clarifications, additions).

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Variant for ALL Funnel Builds (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Variant ($20/month, 3000 designs) is the UI iteration tool for all funnel work — not just HB but Princess massage business, future clients, and reverse-engineered competitor funnels via ad spy tools.

**Why:** Higher fidelity than v0/Loveable for initial iteration. 80% in Variant → 20% precise edits in Claude Code. 60 free designs/day × 4 accounts = 240/day on free tier.

**Impact:** Replaces v0/Loveable in the funnel workflow. Integrates with /ui-explore for final HTML.

### 2. NollyAI Tool Stack (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Freepik Pikaso ($9/mo) + Higgsfield (aggregator containing Kling) + Google Flow/Veo (included in AI Pro). Google Whisk available (user confirmed access).

**Why:** Freepik for character consistency + image remixing. Higgsfield aggregates Kling 2.6, Sora, Veo 3.1, FLUX.2 in one platform. Flow for image-to-video (first frame method). Whisk for subject+scene+style remixing.

**Impact:** $9-16/month for complete storyboard → video pipeline.

### 3. Kling AI Inside Higgsfield (CLARIFICATION)

**Decision:** Kling AI is accessed through Higgsfield (aggregator), not as a separate platform.

**Why:** User corrected — Higgsfield is the aggregator that provides access to Kling + other models.

### 4. Google Whisk Available (CORRECTION)

**Decision:** User confirmed access to Google Whisk despite UK region restrictions.

**Impact:** Whisk stays in NollyAI stack for subject+scene+style image remixing.

### 5. Recursive Skill Scope Expanded (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Recursive self-improvement loop applies to: transcript processing, email sequences, video hooks, positioning, content localization, AND suggesting new skills to build from conversation analysis.

**Why:** Pattern: generate → evaluate (9/10 rubric) → diagnose → improve → repeat. Removes human-in-loop for quality assurance. Also analyzes conversations to suggest automation opportunities.

### 6. HBS Export Processing Priority (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Process HBS Telegram export (Friday CR) NOW, before EP AI Frontrunners group export.

**Why:** HBS export contains 80 voice messages + 200+ texts with unextracted action items for HB Studio business strategy. EP export should wait until work is scoped (then look for specific tool usage).

### 7. Workshop OS in Notion (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** The Workshop Operating System (value ladder: freebie → starter → paid workshop → OS → recurring bookings) lives in Notion.

### 8. Notion as General Tracker (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Notion tracking is not just for HB — it's for general tracking of how things are going across all projects. Building case for paid Notion subscription.

### 9. Funnel Design Workflow (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Load context → verify constraints → wireframe flow → generate prompts → Variant (high-fidelity iteration) → recursive self-review → /ui-explore (Claude Code HTML) → test → connect to existing deployment flows.

**Deploy path:** GitHub Pages → Render

### 10. Ad Spy Tool for Funnel Research (NEW)

**Decision:** Find an ad spy tool for Facebook ads → look at funnels behind those ads → reverse engineer using Variant.

**Why:** Competitor funnels have been tested with real ad spend. Reverse engineering saves months of guessing.

### 11. Antigravity Correction (MINOR)

**Decision:** Last used 26 days ago (not "used for 26 days"). Was buggy, may improve. Still useful for visualizing repos/skills/workflows as maps.

### 12. EP Telegram Export Path (MINOR)

**Decision:** The "Start - Feb 7 Export" in ep-ai-frontrunners/ is the AI Frontrunners Telegram group export (not a course export). Contains messages.html × 3, photos, videos, files.

## WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. Structured Voice Note Extraction (45 items)
- 45 distinct items extracted from ~30-min voice note
- Grouped by project: HB (8), GAS (4), Exploration (10), NollyAI (2), Infra (11), EP (2), Friday Exports (2), New (6)
- 9 correction rounds applied

### 2. Crossover Map
- 8 clusters identified with cross-project connections
- Variant, Recursive Skill, NollyAI Tools, Image/Video Pipeline, DSG Lindy, Notion Hub, Funnel Design, Capture System

### 3. NollyAI Tool Research
- Pricing comparison: Kling AI vs Higgsfield vs Freepik vs Google Whisk
- Recommended stack: Whisk (free) + Freepik ($9/mo) + Kling via Higgsfield + Flow (included)
- Google Whisk vs Flow documentation comparison

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

### 1. Notion In-Progress Items Pulled (11 items)
All links and context extracted from Aloe Labs Work database:
- Workshop Discovery (4 links: Perplexity, Instagram ×2, YouTube)
- Princess Quote (full close flow)
- Puma Pitch + Demo Build
- Pipeline Power Referral
- DSG Lindy Pack → Skill (7 PDFs attached)
- Friday Exports
- Admin Dashboard
- Formalise Notion Claude Connection
- NollyAI
- Recursive Skill (2 X links)
- Exploration (4 links: kie.ai, higgsfield, freepik, Meng To tweet)

### 2. Image/Video Gen Workflow Notes Located
Found in EP Module 5 + video-kb:
- Image gen: Reference → Gemini → Freepik (NanoBanana Pro) → Iterate
- Character consistency: Freepik character panel
- Image-to-video: Freepik → Flow/Veo (first frame method)
- Product pipeline: Notion → WaveSpeed → NanoBanana → Kling

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- Full context loaded from voice note (45 items, 9 correction passes)

- NollyAI tool stack researched and priced ($9-16/month)
- Google Whisk vs Flow capabilities documented
- HBS export located and ready for processing

### 3. Workshop Calculator
Ticket price × attendees - venue cost = net profit. Add-ons (ingredients, equipment). Half-day vs full-day.

### 4. Freebie PDF (Mobile-Ready)
"How to sell out your workshop" — Crafty Mariana format as template. User wants merge code pattern so they can finish on mobile.

## META

**Pattern observed:** Voice-first context loading is the user's primary way of thinking through complex multi-project landscapes. The 30-min voice note contained 45 distinct actionable items across 6 projects. Multiple correction rounds are essential — first pass catches ~85%, corrections add ~15% more context.

**Pattern observed:** 5 parallel agents processing 80 voice messages completed in ~5 minutes. This is the right approach for large transcript processing — split by date/time, run parallel, consolidate.

**Lesson:** Always check Notion in-progress items early. The 11 items had embedded links, PDFs, and context that weren't visible without drilling into page blocks.

**Lesson:** Acuity was already handled — always ask before assuming an operational task is undone. The user had blocked dates through Dec 2027 already.

**Lesson:** Tool research must always check regional availability. Google Whisk was initially flagged as UK-blocked, but user confirmed access.

**Process improvement needed:** Transcript processing rubric (9/10 threshold). Go over transcripts multiple times. → This IS the recursive skill (#1 open item).

**Session status:** 🟡 In Progress — Recursive skill build is next
**Value tier:** HIGH (full context loaded, HBS processed, master writeup complete)
**Impact score:** 9/10 (enables all subsequent work — landscape fully mapped for first time)
