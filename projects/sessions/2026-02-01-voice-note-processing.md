## Action Items

### High Priority (This Week)
- [ ] **Office space search** - Need separate work environment vs home distractions
  - **Why:** "If I know there's an office, regardless I can go there and get stuff done"
  - **Decision:** Office vs gym investment (leaning office)

- [ ] **Fiverr research** - Browse offers, understand ranking algorithms
  - **Why:** Test drop-servicing model with AI execution
  - **Model:** AI does service → Test on Fiverr → Scale with social media if traction
  - **Concern:** Nigeria location stigma ("unless you like spendy board men")

### Medium Priority (Next Week)
- [ ] **Weekend staycation (Ibadan)** - Visit Auntie Dele
  - **Timing:** Next weekend (wait until people leave house to avoid bed requests)
  - **Purpose:** Change of scenery, still work but different place

- [ ] **Workshop knowledge base** - Get from Rochelle
  - **Format:** Google Drive folder + screen recording walkthrough
  - **Content:** Flower Girl workshop materials, prep checklists
  - **Purpose:** Build workshop management in admin dashboard

### Low Priority / Exploratory
- [ ] **Review old ChatGPT chats (2023)** - Memory lane for gold mining
  - **Why:** "How are we doing now? I'll be like, oh yeah, I forgot about this"
  - **When:** After commercial phase, before creative phase

- [ ] **Review bookmarks** - Extract business ideas
  - **Why:** "My bookmarks for me is going to give me so much gold"
  - **Timing:** After revenue stabilizes

- [ ] **Consider buying internet business** - Scale instead of build from scratch
  - **Why:** "Could I buy an internet business and then make it perform better?"
  - **Note:** Cash constraint currently

## Business Insights & Ideas

### Fiverr Drop-Servicing Model

**Description:**
"Drop servicing, but instead of me giving it to a person who then does the service and I make money on the difference, I design the thing to do the thing and then I make money on the difference."

**Workflow:**
1. Customer requests service on Fiverr
2. AI executes service (vs outsourcing to human)
3. Profit on difference between Fiverr rate and AI cost

**Scale strategy:**
- If Fiverr traction → Build faceless social media
- Educate people about problem ("people often struggle with this")
- Drive to own site: "Submit documents, get results"

**Constraint:**
- Nigeria location on Fiverr has poor global PR
- Solution: Partner sets up 501c3, user does backend AI work

**Test hypothesis:**
- "Is it better to be on Fiverr? The test is to do it on Fiverr. If there's any traction on Fiverr, the traction then would give the impulse to then build"

### Data Advantage: AI + Human Intention

**Core insight:**
"I am building the thing which is why all of these big companies have so much money - they have better data. But my data is so much more valuable in my hands because I know what the intention was that an AI can't pick out."

**Example:**
- AI can see 100 actions in a day
- AI can't understand TRUE intention behind actions
- Human (me) can explain intention → AI then knows
- Result: AI + human intention > AI alone

**Application:**
- Picked 2 big issues from Sprint Jan 21-31
- Fixed foundational/infrastructural things
- Result: "Reduced waste, increased comprehension. It's just up, up, up."

**Quote:**
"An AI can't look at 100 actions that I did in a day and truly, truly understand the intention, but I can. And when I explain that, yes, the AI knows."

---

### Leverage Point: Enable Others to Work Together

**Observation:**
"I can show Isaiah stuff. But what's a lot better is if I pair Isaiah with Fope, and then those guys have conversation."

**Pattern:**
- Don't just enable 1:1 (me → Isaiah)
- Enable peer-to-peer (Isaiah ↔ Fope)
- Result: Network effect, not hub-and-spoke

**Scale:**
"This is a model that we can replicate for other family members."

## Mental Models Applied

### 1. Holism (1+1≠2)

**Definition (from voice note):**
"The concept is... one plus one doesn't equal two. It's because when, it's not just one plus one, it's also the fact that you are solving a problem for me, which is an embedded system (business that's already working), and I am solving a problem for you, which is automation."

**Application:**
- HBS has embedded system (working business)
- Nicholas provides automation
- Result: > sum of parts

**Connection to main conversation:**
This is the SAME "vector intersection" concept we discovered today in Scribe design session. User independently described it: "keystone abstraction" = holism.

---

### 2. Momentum > Perfection

**Quote:**
"If something goes wrong but you're still moving forward it's better and that's where you want momentum."

**Evidence:**
- Jan 21-31: "Running so fast, going to drop stuff"
- Feb 1: "Caught these, realized faster way of approaching"
- Sacrificing things (relationships, distractions) but maintaining forward motion

**Rationale:**
"I can even feel that it's going to cause problems but the momentum is worth. I think if something goes wrong but you're still moving forward it's better."

---

### 3. Phased Approach: Commercial → Creative

**Current phase:** Commercial
"I'm avoiding building fun things to build things that have commercial value."

**After commercial phase:** Creative
"After my commercial phase, I will then get into my creative phase."

**Why phases matter:**
"I have to think carefully about this creative phase... the religious phase... I do"

**Cash enables options:**
"Thank God there's a real business involved because there's a part of me that's like, is this just me being extremely manic?"

## Sprint Jan 21-31 Work Summary

**What was built (10 days):**
1. Invoice form
2. Funnel build
3. Admin dashboard
   - Calendar viewing (old + new)
   - Bookings display (date-based business needs different view than calendar)
   - Future: Workshop management
4. PUMA course
5. PUMA games (all sales training games)
6. Gen cell

**Reflection:**
"The amount of... when I think about it now... I should go back to my very, very, very old ChatGPT things and be like, this is in 2023, how are we doing now?"

**Progress measure:**
"I remember trying to make the fucking questionnaire for the forms, for the cupcake orders... the amount of clicking around. The fact that that wasn't that long ago. And now, like, we have a whole funnel with an admin dashboard."

---

## Energy/Emotional State

### Current State
- **High momentum:** "We hit 100% by Sunday"
- **Charged:** "I think I'm charged"
- **Wary of excitement:** "I know that I've been excited about things before and they haven't worked out"
- **Monitoring emotions:** "I have to also monitor my emotions and what annoys me because I think I'm charged"

### Concerns
- **Sacrificing relationships:** "I'm not fucking, I'm not doing any of that stuff... people wouldn't like me for it"
- **Guilt about non-client work:** "This tomorrow I actually apply it to work, because I feel like I've just done 10 days of just like other non-working things"
- **Disorientated:** "I think from the 1st to the 10th was a bit long even now like I'm a bit disorientated but I've done a lot of work"
- **Need for space:** "If someone says something that I find irritating, I just try to ignore it now"

### Needs
- **Office space:** Separate work environment from home
- **Weekend break:** Staycation in Ibadan with Auntie Dele
- **NOT random momentum cut:** "There's no way I'm just going to randomly cut momentum right now"

### Money Mindset
- **Clear:** "I live in Nigeria, so I see how bad things are upheld by money. So no one can tell me that money is not useful."
- **Validation concern:** "A lot of people have a valid opinion, but money, the lack of money means that they cannot put behind their opinion"
- **If had £20k:** "If you had 20 grand and you could fly wherever you wanted... I'm already in that mindset. I'm just pushing towards it."

## Questions for Owner

1. **Office vs Gym - which investment priority?**
   - You mentioned both, leaning office. Confirm?

2. **Fiverr research - specific services to explore?**
   - What services match your AI capabilities?
   - Which have highest volume/margins?

3. **Contact profiles folder - where to create?**
   - Notion database (like Artifact Index)?
   - Flat files in `/projects/contact-profiles/`?
   - Both (Notion + cache layer like Artifact Index)?

4. **Workshop management in admin dashboard - priority level?**
   - Rochelle needs to provide knowledge base first
   - Is this HB roadmap or waiting on her?

5. **Fiverr partner (501c3 setup) - who?**
   - You mentioned having partner set up to avoid Nigeria location issue
   - Is this Syam? Someone else?

## Re-Merge Points for Main Conversation

When returning to Scribe/infrastructure discussion:

1. **Contact Profiles = Personal CRM Index**
   User independently identified need for contact profiles. Main conversation proposed "Personal CRM Index" as part of poly-index architecture. These are the same thing.

2. **Vector Intersection Validation**
   User described holism (1+1≠2) concept independently. This is the EXACT "keystone abstraction" pattern we discovered in Scribe design today. He's living the pattern.

3. **Fiverr = New Business Exploration**
   Drop-servicing with AI execution. Test on Fiverr → Scale with social media. This is a NEW business model to explore (vs HB/PUMA/GAS which are existing).

4. **Data Advantage Insight**
   "AI + human intention > AI alone" - This validates the 99.4% reduction in Scribe design. Session packets exist because human curates intention. AI can't extract intention from raw 6.6MB conversation.

5. **Infrastructure Day Meta-Awareness**
   User is AWARE he did infrastructure day (Feb 1). He's aware of the pattern (run fast → drop things → catch things → build better system). This session packet documents that exact pattern.

6. **Momentum Philosophy**
   "If something goes wrong but you're still moving forward it's better" - This explains Feb Navigation Mode. Sustainable bursts > intensive sprints.
