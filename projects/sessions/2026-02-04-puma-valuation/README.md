## Key Numbers & Framework

### Development Economics (4-Person Team)

| Scenario | Hourly Rate Avg | Total Cost |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Budget Agency | ₦15,000/hr | ₦14,460,000 |
| Mid-Tier Agency | ₦25,000/hr | ₦24,180,000 |
| Premium Agency | ₦40,000/hr | ₦39,600,000 |

**Team:** Learning Designer+Writer, Front-End Developer, UI/UX+Game Designer, Project Manager

**Reality Check:**
- Nigerian salaries: ₦200k-1M/month
- Agency rates 3-4x salary due to overhead, profit, risk premium
- Project rates ≠ monthly salaries

### Pricing Options Presented

**Model 1: Per-Store Licensing**
- Conservative: ₦300k/month
- Mid-Range: ₦400k/month
- Premium: ₦500k/month
- Multi-store discounts: 15-25%

**Model 2: Per-User Licensing**
- ₦25k/user/month (1-15 users)
- ₦20k/user/month (16-50 users)
- ₦15k/user/month (51-100 users)
- ₦12k/user/month (100+ users)

**Model 3: Performance-Based**
- Base: ₦250-400k/month
- Success bonus: 3-5% of incremental revenue
- Aligned incentives

**Model 4: Annual License**
- Pay annually: 17% discount
- 3-year lock-in: 25% discount

### ROI Justification

**Palm Store Example (15 staff):**
- Current basket: ₦25,000
- With 10% improvement: ₦27,500
- Monthly incremental: ₦9,375,000
- Platform cost at ₦400k: **2,244% ROI**

**Break-even:** Only needs 5% basket improvement to justify ₦400k/month pricing

## Commercial Strategy Recommendation

### Phase 1: Free Trial (Current)
- 7 staff, 4-6 weeks
- Prove measurable improvement
- Position as "₦15-40M platform free to test"

### Phase 2: Pilot Paid
- Palm Store, 3 months
- ₦300-400k/month
- Lock in early adopter rate

### Phase 3: Multi-Store Rollout
- ₦400k/store or ₦20k/user
- Volume discount 15-25%
- Annual commitment

### Phase 4: National Enterprise
- Custom pricing at scale (₦300-350k/store)
- 3-year contract
- Example: 20 stores × ₦350k × 36 months = ₦252M total contract value

## Key Insights from Session

### Pricing Psychology
**The Problem:** When you build something yourself, you have no anchor for pricing.

**The Solution:**
- Don't anchor to "what it cost me" (zero, since I built it)
- Anchor to "what it would cost if a team built it" (₦14-40M)
- Anchor to "what value it delivers" (ROI from basket improvement)
- Anchor to "what alternatives cost" (trainer = ₦400-600k/month for 1 person)

**Key Realization:** Confidence in pricing comes from proof of value, not from cost. Position trial as freemium to prove value first, then commercialize.

### Commercial Positioning
**Don't Lead With:** Development cost (invites debate about "should have cost X")

**Lead With:**
- ROI (pays for itself at 5% improvement)
- vs. Alternatives (cheaper than trainer, scales unlike workshops)
- Measurability (track basket size, upsell rate, ramp-up time)

**Frame:** "This isn't a training expense - it's a performance improvement system that costs less than one trainer but covers your entire operation."

### Nigerian Market Context
**Challenge:** Hourly rates look inflated when multiplied out to monthly equivalents.

**Reality:**
- Mid-level developer salary: ₦500-800k/month
- Agency billing: ₦25-40k/hour (3-4x markup)
- Markup covers: overhead, management, profit, risk premium
- Project rates ≠ salaries (need to explain this clearly)

**Approach:** Present multiple scenarios (budget/mid/premium) so partner can choose positioning based on PUMA's commercial reality.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Value Translation
Solo builders struggle to price because they lack market benchmarks. Solution: Research what agencies charge, understand typical team composition, calculate hours at market rates.

### 2. Multiple Options > Single Number
Don't lock into one price. Present range (₦300-500k/month) with rationale for each. Let partner use their commercial judgment on what PUMA will accept.

### 3. ROI Beats Cost
"Platform costs ₦42M to build" is less compelling than "Platform pays for itself with 5% improvement." Lead with value, not cost.

### 4. Context Matters
Nigerian salary expectations require acknowledging reality while explaining why agency rates differ. Transparency builds trust.
