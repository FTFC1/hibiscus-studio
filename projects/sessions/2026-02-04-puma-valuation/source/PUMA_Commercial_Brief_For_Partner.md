### Nigerian Salary vs. Agency Project Rates

**Here's the reality we need to acknowledge:**

#### Typical Nigerian Professional Salaries:
- Junior Developer: ₦200,000 - ₦400,000/month
- Mid-Level Developer: ₦500,000 - ₦800,000/month
- Senior Developer/Designer: ₦800,000 - ₦1,200,000/month
- Project Manager: ₦600,000 - ₦1,000,000/month

**But agencies don't charge salary - they charge project rates.**

#### Why Agency Project Rates Are 3-4x Salary:

**Example: Mid-Level Developer**
- Monthly Salary: ₦600,000
- Agency Overhead:
  - Benefits (13th month, pension): +15% = ₦90,000
  - Office/equipment: +10% = ₦60,000
  - Management/administration: +20% = ₦120,000
  - Agency profit margin: +30% = ₦180,000
- **Agency Monthly Billing**: ₦1,050,000
- **Agency Hourly Rate**: ₦1,050,000 ÷ 160 hours = **₦6,560/hour**

Wait, that's only ₦6,560/hour, not ₦40,000/hour...

#### The Reality of Project-Based Agency Rates:

Agencies charge higher hourly rates for project work (vs. retainer) because:
1. **No guarantee of full utilization** - might only bill 80-100 hours/month per person
2. **Risk premium** - fixed deliverables, variable effort
3. **Expertise premium** - specialized skills command higher rates
4. **Market positioning** - premium agencies charge premium rates

**Market Reality in Nigeria:**
- **Budget agencies**: ₦8,000 - ₦15,000/hour
- **Mid-tier agencies**: ₦15,000 - ₦30,000/hour
- **Premium agencies**: ₦30,000 - ₦60,000/hour
- **International agencies (Lagos offices)**: ₦50,000 - ₦100,000/hour

### Black Box Project Cost (Alternative Framing)

**If you don't want to show hourly rates, use this:**

"Similar e-learning platforms built by Nigerian agencies typically cost:
- **Budget tier**: ₦10-15M
- **Mid-tier**: ₦20-30M
- **Premium tier**: ₦35-50M

This platform would fall in the mid-to-premium tier based on:
- Custom content (not templates)
- Interactive games (not just videos)
- Mobile-optimized (not just responsive)
- Nigerian market context (not generic)"

---

## Pricing Options for Discussion

### Current State: What PUMA Spends on Training

*(You'll know better than me, but typical scenarios):*

**Option A: No formal training**
- New hires learn from senior staff (inconsistent)
- Cost: ₦0/month but 2-3 months ramp-up time
- Lost revenue: Hard to quantify

**Option B: Traditional training**
- Workshop facilitators: ₦200-500k per session
- Frequency: Quarterly or ad-hoc
- Cost: ₦800k - 2M/year per store
- Problem: One-time learning, no reinforcement

**Option C: Full-time trainer**
- Salary: ₦400-600k/month
- Covers: 1-2 locations maximum
- Cost: ₦4.8M - 7.2M/year
- Problem: Can't scale, inconsistent when trainer unavailable

---

### Proposed Pricing Models

#### Model 1: Per-Store Licensing (Monthly SaaS)

| Tier | Price/Month | Covers | Best For |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Conservative** | ₦300,000 | Up to 15 staff | Testing commercial viability |
| **Mid-Range** | ₦400,000 | Up to 15 staff | Balanced value positioning |
| **Premium** | ₦500,000 | Up to 15 staff | Emphasizing continuous value |

**What's Included:**
- Full platform access for all staff
- Monthly content updates
- Performance analytics dashboard
- Telegram community access

**Multi-Store Discounts:**
- 5+ stores: 15% discount
- 10+ stores: 25% discount
- All stores (national): Custom enterprise pricing

---

#### Model 2: Per-User Licensing

| User Count | Price/User/Month | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1-15 users | ₦25,000 | ₦375,000 | ₦4,500,000 |
| 16-50 users | ₦20,000 | ₦400k-1M | ₦4.8M-12M |
| 51-100 users | ₦15,000 | ₦765k-1.5M | ₦9.2M-18M |
| 100+ users | ₦12,000 | Custom | Custom |

**Why this might work:**
- Scales naturally with store size
- PUMA can start small (pilot) and expand
- Fair pricing (pay for what you use)

---

#### Model 3: Performance-Based Pricing

**Structure**: Base fee + success bonus tied to results

| Component | Amount | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Base Platform Fee** | ₦250,000 - ₦400,000/month | Covers platform access, updates |
| **Performance Bonus** | 3-5% of incremental basket size revenue | Aligned incentives - you win when they win |

**Example Calculation:**

**Baseline:**
- Average basket: ₦25,000
- Sales/day: 150 (15 staff × 10 sales each)
- Monthly revenue: ₦93.75M (150 × 25 days × ₦25k)

**After Training (10% basket improvement):**
- Average basket: ₦27,500
- Sales/day: 150
- Monthly revenue: ₦103.125M
- **Incremental**: ₦9.375M

**Pricing:**
- Base fee: ₦300,000
- Performance bonus (5% of ₦9.375M): ₦468,750
- **Total**: ₦768,750/month

**Why this is compelling:**
- PUMA only pays more when results are proven
- De-risks the investment
- Requires rigorous tracking (could be complicated)

---

#### Model 4: Annual License (Upfront Payment)

| Option | Annual Price | Monthly Equivalent | Discount |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Pay Monthly** | ₦4,800,000 | ₦400,000 | 0% |
| **Pay Annually** | ₦4,000,000 | ₦333,333 | 17% |
| **3-Year Lock-in** | ₦10,800,000 | ₦300,000 | 25% |

**Why this might work:**
- Cash flow advantage for you
- Discount incentive for PUMA
- Commitment = better adoption

---

### Pricing Decision Matrix

**Conservative Approach** (Easier to get approved):
- Start: ₦300k/month per store
- 7-person pilot → Palm Store (15 staff) → Multi-store rollout
- Low price = low resistance, easier to prove value

**Mid-Range Approach** (Balanced):
- Start: ₦400k/month per store
- Emphasize ROI (pays for itself at 10% improvement)
- Compare to trainer cost (₦400-600k/month for 1 person)

**Premium Approach** (High anchoring):
- Start: ₦500-600k/month per store
- Position as enterprise solution
- Risk: Harder to get initial buy-in

**My Recommendation for YOU to consider:**
- **Start conservative in trial** (free)
- **Mid-range for first paid phase** (₦400k/month)
- **Upsell to higher tiers** as value is proven
- **Offer annual lock-in discount** to secure revenue

---

## ROI Justification (For Your Pitch)

### Scenario: Palm Store (15 staff)

**Current State:**
- Average basket: ₦25,000
- Sales per staff per day: 10
- Daily store sales: 150 sales × ₦25,000 = ₦3,750,000
- Monthly sales (25 days): ₦93,750,000

**With 10% Basket Improvement** (conservative estimate):
- Average basket: ₦27,500 (+₦2,500)
- Daily store sales: 150 sales × ₦27,500 = ₦4,125,000
- Monthly sales: ₦103,125,000
- **Monthly incremental**: ₦9,375,000

**Platform Cost vs. Impact:**

| Pricing Tier | Monthly Cost | Incremental Revenue | Net Gain | ROI |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|----------|-----|
| ₦300k/month | ₦300,000 | ₦9,375,000 | ₦9,075,000 | 3,025% |
| ₦400k/month | ₦400,000 | ₦9,375,000 | ₦8,975,000 | 2,244% |
| ₦500k/month | ₦500,000 | ₦9,375,000 | ₦8,875,000 | 1,775% |

**Key Insight**: Even at ₦500k/month, the ROI is extraordinary if you deliver 10% basket improvement.

---

### What If Results Are Less Than 10%?

| Basket Increase | Incremental/Month | Break-Even Pricing |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 5% (₦1,250) | ₦4,687,500 | ₦4.6M (unrealistic) |
| 7.5% (₦1,875) | ₦7,031,250 | ₦7M (still high) |
| 10% (₦2,500) | ₦9,375,000 | ₦9.3M (comfortable) |

**The platform only needs 5% basket improvement to justify ₦400k/month pricing.**

---

## Alternative Value Comparisons

**Instead of anchoring to development cost, anchor to alternatives:**

### Option A: Do Nothing
- Cost: ₦0
- Result: Inconsistent performance, long ramp-up for new hires, missed upsell opportunities
- Hidden cost: Opportunity cost of lost revenue

### Option B: Hire Full-Time Trainer
- Cost: ₦400-600k/month salary + benefits = ₦500-700k/month
- Coverage: 1-2 stores maximum
- Scalability: Can't be in multiple places
- Consistency: Depends on trainer availability/quality

### Option C: Traditional Training Workshops
- Cost: ₦300-500k per session
- Frequency: Quarterly = ₦1.2M - 2M/year
- Problem: One-time learning, no reinforcement, high attrition

### Option D: Platform
- Cost: ₦300-500k/month
- Coverage: All staff, all stores (scalable)
- Consistency: 24/7 access, standardized content
- Measurability: Track performance, iterate based on data

**Positioning**: "This isn't a training expense - it's a performance improvement system that costs less than a trainer but covers your entire operation."

---

## Recommended Commercial Strategy

### Phase 1: Free Trial (Current)
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks
- **Participants**: 7 staff at one location
- **Objective**: Prove measurable improvement (basket size, upsell rate, staff confidence)
- **Messaging**: "₦15-40M platform provided free to validate value"

### Phase 2: Pilot Paid Deployment
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Location**: Palm Store (up to 15 staff)
- **Pricing**: ₦300k-400k/month
- **Objective**: Prove scalability beyond initial cohort
- **Early adopter incentive**: Lock in this rate for 12 months

### Phase 3: Multi-Store Rollout
- **Pricing**: ₦400k/store/month OR ₦20k/user/month
- **Volume discount**: 15-25% for 5+ stores
- **Contract**: Annual commitment with quarterly review

### Phase 4: National Enterprise Deal
- **Pricing**: Custom (₦300-350k/store/month at scale)
- **Terms**: 3-year contract, dedicated support, custom content
- **Total Contract Value**: If 20 stores × ₦350k × 36 months = ₦252M over 3 years

## Questions to Inform Your Positioning

**You'll know better than me, but consider:**

1. **Budget Authority**: Who signs off on ₦300k/month vs. ₦500k/month? Different approval levels?

2. **Procurement Process**: Does PUMA prefer monthly SaaS or annual licenses?

3. **Performance Metrics**: Are they already tracking basket size, upsell rate? Will they be comfortable with performance-based pricing?

4. **Current Training Spend**: What do they spend now? (This is your real anchor, not development cost)

5. **Decision Timeline**: Fast decision favors conservative pricing. Long sales cycle allows for higher anchoring.

6. **Competitive Context**: Are other retail brands in Nigeria doing anything similar? First-mover advantage?

---

## Bottom Line for Your Negotiation

**What to emphasize:**
- Platform delivers measurable results (not just "training")
- Pays for itself with small basket size improvement (5-10%)
- Scales across all stores (unlike trainer)
- Continuous improvement (unlike workshop)

**How to position pricing:**
- **Don't lead with development cost** (invites debate about what it "should" cost)
- **Lead with ROI** (₦400k/month pays for itself at 5% improvement)
- **Compare to alternatives** (cheaper than trainer, more effective than workshops)

**Pricing range to test:**
- **Floor**: ₦300k/month (easy yes, leaves money on table)
- **Target**: ₦400k/month (balanced, strong ROI case)
- **Ceiling**: ₦500k/month (requires strong performance proof)

**Your call based on:**
- Their budget reality
- Your read of their urgency
- Competitive dynamics
- Your revenue needs

---

**Use your judgment. This brief gives you the tools - you make the commercial call based on what you know about PUMA that I don't.**
