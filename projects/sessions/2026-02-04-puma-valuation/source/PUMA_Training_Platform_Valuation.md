### Price Anchoring:
- **High Anchor**: US agency cost (₦151M)
- **Mid Anchor**: Nigerian agency cost (₦43M)
- **Your Price**: ₦200-250k/month (0.5-0.6% of development cost monthly)

2. **During Trial**: Track KPIs religiously (basket size, upsell %, staff confidence scores)
3. **Post-Trial**: Present results + pricing proposal
