# Session Packet: Agency Positioning via EP Analysis

**Session Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (strategy defined, execution continues)
**Duration:** ~2h
**Work Type:** Strategic planning + EP framework application

---

## CONTEXT

User at crossroads:
- **Tension:** Generator sales (current 9-5 revenue) vs Building agency (desired exit using skills)
- **Proof points:** HB booking system working (Francesca £645 booking), someone else interested in funnel
- **Constraint:** Funds low, needs revenue soon
- **Question:** What are first 10 steps EP would recommend? Should I quit GAS? Build infoproduct or agency?

**Key assets:**
- HB Studio booking system (live, working: funnel + calendar + email automation + admin dashboard on Cloudflare Workers)
- Princess (warm lead: wants simple booking system for massage sessions)
- EP course frameworks (M2 Product Research, M3 Product Creation)
- Jack Butcher content (wants to add layers on top of EP)

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Focus on Agency Model First (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Build agency (booking system builds) FIRST, not infoproduct or software

**Why (EP M3L2):**
- Infoproducts require authority user doesn't have yet (need 3+ client case studies first)
- Agency = get paid while building proof
- "Services sell on portfolio. Infoproducts sell on YOU & your experience. Can't build authority while selling."

**Impact:** Don't pursue course/template until after 3 clients + documented results (6-12 months minimum)

**Next steps:**
- Close Princess (Client #2)
- Find Client #3 (Rule of Three validation)
- Build authority content from client work
- THEN decide: More agency? Package product? Build software?

---

### 2. Keep GAS, Run Both Parallel (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Don't quit generator sales yet. Run GAS (9-5) + Agency (evenings/weekends) in parallel.

**Why:**
- Funds low = can't afford long runway without revenue
- Agency takes 3-6 months to validate (3 clients + refine process)
- EP validation pattern: Prove it works BEFORE quitting stable income

**Exit trigger:** When agency revenue consistently > GAS revenue for 3 months

**Impact:** User will be running two businesses for 3-6 months (high energy cost, but necessary)

---

### 3. Two Different Business Models: HB vs Princess (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Separate HB (anchor client, ongoing retainer) from Princess (scalable offer, project-based)

**HB Studio (Anchor Client - Won't Churn):**
- Long-term relationship
- Already built: Funnel + calendar + email automation + admin dashboard (Cloudflare Workers)
- Current project: Workshop instructor lead gen (find instructors, HB does IG outreach)
- Revenue model: Retainer or project-based for ongoing work
- Workshop opportunity: £750 venue booking (instructor runs 10-person workshop at £75/ticket)

**Princess (Scalable Offer - Testing):**
- New client (may churn)
- Simple booking system for massage sessions
- Fixed project fee (£500-£1500 depending on tier)
- Optional maintenance retainer after delivery
- Template for future solo practitioner clients

**Why separate:** HB is custom/ongoing, Princess is repeatable/scalable. Don't try to make HB model scalable.

**Impact:** Scalable offer focus = Princess-type clients (solo practitioners needing booking systems). HB is separate revenue stream.

---

### 4. Princess Intake Process: 4-Step Async (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Use multimodal async intake (no 3-hour discovery calls)

**Process:**
1. **Send HB demo link:** "Play with it, book fake appointment. Voice note: what would you keep/change for massage bookings?"
2. **Voice note walkthrough:** "Walk me through ideal customer journey (how they find you → book → pay → confirmation)"
3. **Screenshots/examples:** "Your current process (if any), systems you like, your branding (colors, fonts, vibe)"
4. **10-question form** (AFTER voice notes): Calendar tool, payment processor, session types, pricing, availability, cancellation policy, reminders, customer info needed, integrations

**Why:**
- Client time: 30 minutes total (not 3 calls)
- Async = no scheduling friction
- Voice notes = richer context than email
- 10 questions AFTER voice notes = informed by what they said (not generic)

**Impact:** Replicable for every client. Refines to 5 minutes after 3 clients.

**This intake process itself = part of agency offering** (professional, efficient, client-friendly)

---

### 5. Payment Timing: 50/50 Deposit (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** 50% deposit after specs (before build), 50% on delivery

**Why:**
- Filters tire-kickers (if won't pay deposit, won't pay final)
- Covers spec/design time if client ghosts
- Professional signal (serious businesses expect deposits)
- Protects cash flow (don't work for free)

**For Princess:** £250 deposit (after intake completed), £250 on delivery

**Alternative considered:** Full payment upfront (harder to close), Payment on delivery only (risky if client ghosts)

**Impact:** Standard practice, reduces collections risk, professional positioning

---

## WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. Princess Async Intake Process (4-Step Framework)
- **Deliverable:** Replicable client onboarding workflow
- **Format:** Demo link → Voice notes → Screenshots → 10 questions
- **Client time:** 30 minutes total (no calls)
- **Benefit:** Scalable, professional, efficient

### 2. Pricing Tier Framework (Simple/Standard/Premium)

**Simple (£500-£750):**
- Custom funnel page
- Calendar integration (Google Cal or Calendly)
- Payment processing (Stripe or PayPal)
- 1 week delivery

**Standard (£1000-£1500):**
- Everything in Simple
- Email automation (confirmations, reminders)
- Custom branding
- 2 weeks delivery

**Premium (£2000+):**
- Everything in Standard
- Custom backend dashboard (like HB)
- Advanced integrations (CRM, analytics)
- 3-4 weeks delivery

**Princess likely fits:** Simple or Standard tier (needs refinement after her specs come in)

### 3. HB Workshop Lead Gen Scope (Low-Touch Service)

**User's role:**
1. Build lead list (30-50 instructors with content/audience)
2. Define thesis (who to target: wellness? creative? fitness?)
3. Write IG outreach templates for Rochelle

**HB's role:**
- Outreach from their Instagram page
- Close bookings
- Run workshops

**Revenue model:** TBD after validation (5-10 bookings), then discuss with Rochelle

**Why low-touch:** Research + templates only. HB executes. Not user's core business, just helping anchor client.

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

### 1. Agency Positioning Clarity

**Before:** Unclear if doing infoproduct, agency, or software. Unclear if HB is case study or active client.

**After:**
- Agency model first (build booking systems)
- HB = anchor client (ongoing, won't churn)
- Princess = scalable offer test (project-based)
- Infoproduct/software = after 3 clients + authority

### 2. Scalable Offer Definition

**What's scalable:** Princess-type clients (solo practitioners: massage, beauty, wellness)
- Booking system builds
- Async intake process
- Fixed pricing tiers
- Optional maintenance retainer

**What's NOT scalable:** HB workshop partnerships (custom, high-touch, not repeatable)

### 3. Payment Structure

**Before:** Unclear when to charge Princess (before specs? after build?)

**After:** 50/50 split
- £250 deposit (after intake, before build)
- £250 on delivery
- Standard agency practice

---

## EP FRAMEWORKS APPLIED

### M3L1: Pick One Model (Don't Build All Three at Once)
- **Applied:** Agency first (not infoproduct + agency + software simultaneously)
- **Insight:** Infoproduct requires authority user doesn't have yet
- **Recommendation:** Services → Authority → Product (6-12 month timeline)

### M3L2: Infoproduct Prerequisites
- **Applied:** User can't sell course yet (no track record, no authority positioning)
- **Insight:** "Info is harder to sell than services IF you don't have authority. Authority requires consistent demonstration over time."
- **Recommendation:** Do client work, build case studies, THEN package into course

### M2L2: Mining Problems from Experience
- **Applied:** HB booking system = user's solved problem (proof of concept)
- **Validation:** Francesca booking (£645), someone else interested = validation signals
- **Next step:** Replicate for Princess + 1 more client (Rule of Three)

### M2L3: Market Validation - 5 Dimensions
- **Applied:** Early validation (Princess wants what user built for HB)
- **Missing validation:** Keyword demand, competitive landscape, full value gap calculation
- **Next step:** After 3 clients, validate market size + scalability

### M2L4: Value Gap & Competitive Edges
- **Edges identified:**
  - **Experience:** Built HB system (live, working, proof not theory)
  - **Access:** HB demo (prospects can test live system, not just see portfolio)
  - **Technical:** Cloudflare Workers backend (not just Calendly wrapper)
- **Value gap:** Time saved (no manual booking back-and-forth), conversion increase (frictionless booking)

### M3L6: Niching Down
- **Applied:** Target solo practitioners (massage, beauty, wellness) with booking friction
- **Why:** HB + Princess reveal pattern (service businesses needing appointment booking)
- **Next step:** After 3 clients, confirm niche or broaden

### M2L7: Solution Formats (Education vs Automation vs Implementation)
- **Applied:** Currently doing Implementation (build + deploy + handoff)
- **Considered:** Automation (template they customize) OR Education (teach them to build)
- **Decision:** Stay Implementation for now (highest value, easiest to sell without authority)

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- ✅ **Clarity on next steps:** Close Princess, find Client #3, don't quit GAS yet
- ✅ **Intake process designed:** Replicable 4-step async workflow (saves 3 discovery calls)
- ✅ **Payment structure defined:** 50/50 deposit protects cash flow
- ✅ **HB vs Princess separated:** Anchor client vs scalable offer (don't confuse the two)

### Foundational
- ✅ **EP frameworks mapped to actual work:** Not theoretical, applied to user's crossroads decision
- ✅ **Scalable offer identified:** Princess-type clients = repeatable booking system builds
- ✅ **6-12 month roadmap:** Agency (now) → Authority (after 3 clients) → Product (when ready)
- ✅ **Pricing tiers framework:** Simple/Standard/Premium (refine after Princess specs)

---

## OPEN ITEMS

### 1. Send Princess Async Intake (This Week)
- **Action:** Send HB demo link + voice note request + screenshot request
- **Wait for:** Her specs (30 min her time)
- **Then:** Send 10-question form (informed by her voice notes)
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days for her response

### 2. Define HB Workshop Instructor Thesis (This Week)
- **Question:** Who to target? (Wellness instructors? Creative workshops? Fitness trainers?)
- **Research:** Find 30-50 with content + audience (Instagram, YouTube, existing courses)
- **Deliverable:** Lead list + IG outreach templates for Rochelle
- **Timeline:** 1 week (low priority vs Princess)

### 3. Quote Princess After Specs (Next Week)
- **Wait for:** Her intake responses
- **Draft:** Proposal with pricing tier (Simple vs Standard based on her needs)
- **Payment terms:** £250 deposit, £250 delivery
- **Close:** Get deposit → Start build

### 4. Find Client #3 (This Month)
- **Pattern:** Who else is like Princess? (Solo practitioners with booking friction)
- **Channels:** Warm referrals (ask HB, ask Princess after delivery), LinkedIn warm outreach
- **Goal:** 3 clients = Rule of Three validation

---

## NON-OBVIOUS INSIGHTS

### Insight 1: HB = Learning Lab, Princess = Paid Client
- **Pattern:** Don't charge HB for workshop lead gen experimentation (prove value first)
- **But:** Charge Princess for proven booking system process (you already built it for HB)
- **EP lens (M3):** "Do services, get paid while building proof, then package"
- **Applied:** HB taught you the process, Princess pays for what you learned

### Insight 2: "Custom Funnel" Positioning > "Booking System"
- **User quote:** "The thing they like most is the funnel"
- **Why this matters:** Princess doesn't care about "booking system" (technical). She cares about "easy way for customers to book" (outcome).
- **Positioning shift:** "Custom booking funnel" (sounds bespoke, premium) vs "Booking system" (sounds commodity)

### Insight 3: GAS Referral Strategy Applies to Agency
- **From Feb 2-3 sessions:** Fisayo model (warm referrals) > cold LinkedIn (Nigerian context)
- **Applied to agency:** Ask HB for intros, ask Francesca (who else needs booking?), LinkedIn warm outreach
- **Don't:** Build cold funnel for agency sales (ironic waste of time)

### Insight 4: Jack Butcher Content = Authority Layer (Not First Product)
- **User wants:** "Add my own layers on top [Jack Butcher content]"
- **EP caution:** Can't sell course without authority (need 3+ case studies first)
- **Right use now:** Study his positioning frameworks (Visual Thinking, curation), apply to AGENCY positioning, package into course LATER (after authority)

### Insight 5: Async Intake Process Itself = Competitive Advantage
- **Most agencies:** 3 discovery calls, 2 weeks back-and-forth, client exhausted before project starts
- **User's process:** 30 min client time, all async, starts with demo (not blank slate questions)
- **Differentiation:** "I don't need 3 calls to quote you. Send voice notes, I'll have proposal in 48h."

## CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

### Challenge 1: "How Will I Know Traffic/Marketing If I Don't Do It?"
- **User pushback:** "You're telling me to focus on building systems, THEN learn traffic. But how will I know the process if I don't practice now?"
- **Context:** HB needs bookings (Rochelle's cash flow pinch), Princess will need traffic later
- **Resolution:** Do HB workshop lead gen NOW (builds skill), charge Princess for proven process LATER
- **Pattern:** HB = learning lab (low-risk experimentation), Princess = paid client (proven process)

### Challenge 2: Positioning Confusion (HB Workshop Model)
- **Initial misunderstanding:** Thought user was managing ticket sales + revenue splits for HB workshops
- **Actual model:** User finds instructors (lead list), HB does IG outreach, instructor sells own tickets
- **Why it matters:** This is WAY simpler (just research + templates, not ongoing partnerships)
- **Correction:** HB workshop lead gen = low-touch service (help anchor client), NOT core scalable business

### Challenge 3: HB as "Case Study" vs "Active Client"
- **Initial framing:** Treated HB like past project (proof of concept for portfolio)
- **User correction:** "HB is still one of the people we've done this booking service for. You've forgotten that."
- **Actual relationship:** HB = anchor client (retainer, ongoing projects, won't churn)
- **Why it matters:** Princess may churn (new, unproven). HB is stable revenue while building agency.

---

## PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: EP "Pick One Model" Prevents Shiny Object Syndrome
- User wanted to do infoproduct + agency + software + traffic/marketing simultaneously
- EP framework forced prioritization: Agency first (get paid while building proof)
- Infoproduct/software = after 3 clients + authority (6-12 months)

### Pattern 2: Warm Lead (Princess) Validates Faster Than Theory
- EP M2L3: Market validation isn't "scrolling Reddit for 3 hours"
- Princess asking for booking system = real demand signal
- Better than building first, hoping customers appear

### Pattern 3: Async Intake Scales, Calls Don't
- User designing multimodal intake (voice notes, screenshots, forms)
- Replicable for every client
- After 3 clients, refines to 5 minutes (not 3 hours)

### Pattern 4: Anchor Client (HB) De-Risks New Client Acquisition
- HB = stable revenue, ongoing projects, won't churn
- Princess = testing scalable offer, may churn
- User can afford to experiment BECAUSE HB is stable base

---

## META

**What went well:**
- ✅ User challenged "10-step checklist" thinking (realistic about 6-12 month timeline)
- ✅ EP frameworks applied to actual crossroads (not theoretical business school case)
- ✅ User corrected misunderstandings (HB relationship, workshop model, positioning)
- ✅ Designed replicable processes (intake, payment, pricing tiers)

**What could improve:**
- ⚠️ Initial framing missed HB as active client (not just case study)
- ⚠️ Overcomplicated HB workshop model (thought user was managing ticket sales)
- ⚠️ Need to validate Princess pricing after specs come in (£500-£1500 range, but which tier?)

**Process improvement:**
- Always ask: "Is this client ongoing or one-off?" (HB = anchor, Princess = project)
- Separate scalable from non-scalable EARLY (don't force every opportunity into one business model)
- Validate pricing after specs (not before) - can't quote without knowing scope

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Send Princess intake** (demo link, voice note request, screenshots)
2. **Draft HB workshop thesis** (who to target for lead list)
3. **Refine pricing tiers** (after Princess specs, adjust Simple/Standard/Premium)
4. **Update artifact index** (add intake process, pricing framework, workshop scope)
5. **Find Client #3 channels** (where to look for Princess-type clients)
