# Session Packet: HB Workshop Lead Gen via Exa Search

**Session Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** 🟡 In Progress (search strategy defined, Exa query ready)
**Duration:** ~1.5h
**Work Type:** Implementation + Research

---

## CONTEXT

**Starting point:**
- HB Studio has fully integrated commercial kitchen (rare, valuable asset)
- Princess intake was next priority (agency client work)
- User pivoted: "Building lead list more important than Princess"
- Goal: Find workshop instructors who need kitchen space (Rochelle's cash flow)

**Why this matters:**
- HB workshop bookings = immediate revenue (£750+ per workshop)
- Commercial kitchen = differentiator (yoga studios are commodity, kitchens are scarce)
- Baking workshop instructors actively looking for kitchen access

**User insight:** "The HB space has a full integrated kitchen. I think we can go for a better target ICP. Bakers for example."

---

## DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Pivot ICP from Yoga to Baking Workshops (CRITICAL)

**Decision:** Target sourdough/baking instructors instead of yoga instructors

**Why:**
- **Kitchen = rare asset:** Most yoga instructors can rent any studio. Commercial kitchens are EXPENSIVE and SCARCE.
- **Higher workshop prices:** Baking workshops = £75-£100/person (vs £30-£50 yoga). 8-12 people = £680-£1,020 per session.
- **Stronger need:** Bakers CAN'T run workshops in home kitchens at scale (health regulations, equipment, space).
- **Multiple sessions/day:** Can run morning, afternoon, evening workshops (2-3x daily revenue vs 1x yoga class).

**Impact:**
- HB becomes venue for sourdough/pastry/cooking workshops (not just wellness/yoga)
- Higher revenue per booking (£750-£1,000+ vs £500-£600)
- Instructors have URGENT need (can't teach bread workshops without commercial kitchen)

**Target workshop types:**
- Sourdough bread making (hottest market right now)
- Pastry workshops (croissants, tarts, etc.)
- Pasta making (fresh pasta, ravioli)
- International cuisine (Thai, Italian, Japanese cooking)
- Fermentation workshops (kimchi, kombucha, pickling)

---

### 2. Simplify Exa Search Criteria (2-3 Strong Filters Only) (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Use 2-3 verifiable criteria instead of 5-6 detailed criteria

**Why (based on Exa results screenshot):**
- Too many criteria = too many "unclear" results
- User's first search had 5+ criteria → Most results showed "Unclear" (wasted credits)
- Exa can't verify everything from Instagram profiles alone (especially "does not own commercial kitchen")
- Manual filtering is FREE and FAST (30 seconds per account)

**Before (too complex):**
```
Instagram accounts of south east or east London based sourdough bread baking
instructors with 2000-20000 followers who teach workshops but do not own
their own yoga studio or permanent venue, have workshop content visible in
their posts, professional bio mentioning workshops or retreats or training,
engaged audience with comments from students
```

**After (simplified):**
```
Instagram accounts of sourdough baking instructors in South East or East London
with 2000-20000 followers who teach baking classes or workshops
```

**What was removed (causes "unclear"):**
- ❌ "does not own commercial kitchen or bakery" - Too specific, not in bio
- ❌ "engaged audience with comments from students" - Too granular
- ❌ "posts visibly feature workshop content and professional bio mentions..." - Too wordy

**What was kept (Exa verifies reliably):**
- ✅ Location: "South East or East London" (shows in bio)
- ✅ Topic: "sourdough baking instructors" (shows in bio/description)
- ✅ Activity: "teach baking classes or workshops" (shows in bio keywords)
- ✅ Follower count: 2000-20000 (Exa verifies this)

**Impact:**
- More "Match" results, fewer "Unclear" (saves credits)
- Faster results (Exa doesn't waste time verifying unverifiable criteria)
- Manual filter takes 10-15 minutes for 20-30 accounts (vs hours of unclear filtering)

---

### 3. Manual Filter After Exa Results (30 Seconds Per Account) (IMPORTANT)

**Decision:** Let Exa do what it does well (location, keywords, follower count), then manually filter for ownership

**Process:**
1. Exa returns 20-30 sourdough instructors (2K-20K followers, SE/East London, teach classes)
2. User manually scans bios (30 seconds each):
   - **Keep:** "Home baker teaching sourdough classes"
   - **Keep:** "Sourdough workshop facilitator, DM to book"
   - **Keep:** "Pop-up baker teaching bread making"
   - **Skip:** "Owner of Sourdough & Co bakery"
   - **Skip:** "Head baker at [Restaurant Name]"
   - **Skip:** "Commercial bakery in [Location]"

**Why this works:**
- Exa focuses on what it verifies well (location, keywords, follower count)
- Human does what human does well (spotting "owns bakery" in bio text)
- 30 seconds per account × 20 accounts = 10 minutes total (very fast)

**Impact:**
- 15-20 qualified leads (don't own kitchen, need space, teach workshops)
- Credits saved (fewer "unclear" results)
- High-quality list (manually verified they need HB's kitchen)

---

## WHAT WAS CREATED

### 1. Simplified Exa Search Query (Final Version)

**File:** Documented in this session packet

**Query:**
```
Instagram accounts of sourdough baking instructors in South East or East London
with 2000-20000 followers who teach baking classes or workshops
```

**Settings:**
- Domain filter: `includeDomains: ["instagram.com"]`
- Results: 30-50 (quality over quantity)
- Category: General search (not "people" - that's LinkedIn-only)

**Alternative queries (if sourdough results limited):**
- Pastry/dessert workshops: `Instagram accounts of pastry or dessert workshop instructors in South East or East London with 2000-20000 followers who teach baking classes`
- Cooking classes (broader): `Instagram accounts of cooking class instructors in South East or East London with 2000-20000 followers who teach cooking workshops`

---

### 2. Manual Filter Checklist (Post-Exa Process)

**Step 1: Quick scan bio (30 seconds per account)**
- Bio says "Owner of [Bakery]" → Skip
- Bio says "Commercial bakery in [Location]" → Skip
- Bio says "Head baker at [Restaurant]" → Skip
- Bio says "Pop-up baker" or "Home baker" → Keep
- Bio says "Workshop facilitator" or "Classes at [rotating venues]" → Keep

**Step 2: Build CSV (after filtering)**
- Name
- IG handle
- Follower count
- Workshop type (sourdough, pastry, pasta, etc.)
- Last workshop post date
- Notes (any special context)

**Step 3: Write IG outreach template for Rochelle**
- Variations by type (sourdough, pastry, cooking)
- Sent from HB Instagram account
- Message: "Love your [workshop type]. We have fully equipped commercial kitchen in [location], interested in hosting in-person workshops?"

---

## WHAT WAS UPDATED

### 1. HB Workshop Strategy

**Before:** Yoga/wellness instructors (commodity ICP, any studio works)

**After:** Sourdough/baking instructors (scarce kitchen asset, urgent need)

**Revenue impact:**
- Yoga workshop: £500-£600 (10 people × £50-£60)
- Baking workshop: £750-£1,020 (8-12 people × £75-£100)
- Multiple daily sessions possible (morning/afternoon/evening)

---

### 2. Exa Search Strategy

**Before:** Too many detailed criteria → "unclear" results → wasted credits

**After:** 2-3 strong criteria (location, topic, followers) → "match" results → manual filter

**Learning:** Exa is neural search, not traditional boolean. Simpler queries with verifiable criteria perform better.

---

## VALUE DELIVERED

### Immediate
- ✅ **Better ICP identified:** Baking instructors > yoga instructors (kitchen = differentiator)
- ✅ **Exa search optimized:** Simplified query saves credits, reduces "unclear" results
- ✅ **Manual filter process:** 10-15 minutes to clean 20-30 accounts (fast, free, accurate)

### Foundational
- ✅ **HB kitchen positioning:** Commercial kitchen = rare asset (not just "studio space")
- ✅ **Higher revenue potential:** £750-£1,020 per workshop vs £500-£600 yoga
- ✅ **Replicable process:** Exa search → manual filter → outreach (works for any vertical)

---

## OPEN ITEMS

### 1. Run Exa Search (This Week)
- **Query:** Sourdough baking instructors, SE/East London, 2K-20K followers, teach classes
- **Expected results:** 20-30 accounts
- **Time:** 5 minutes to run search

### 2. Manual Filter Results (This Week)
- **Process:** Scan bios for "owns bakery/kitchen" (skip those)
- **Keep:** Pop-up bakers, home bakers, workshop facilitators
- **Time:** 10-15 minutes for 20-30 accounts
- **Output:** CSV with 15-20 qualified leads

### 3. Write IG Outreach Template for Rochelle (This Week)
- **Variations:** Sourdough, pastry, cooking (3 templates)
- **Key message:** "We have fully equipped commercial kitchen, interested in hosting workshops?"
- **Sent from:** HB Instagram account (Rochelle does outreach, not user)
- **Time:** 30 minutes to write 3 templates

### 4. Track Conversion (After Rochelle Sends)
- **Metric:** How many respond? How many book?
- **Goal:** 5-10 instructor bookings = validation
- **Then:** Talk money with Rochelle (charge for lead gen service? Revenue share?)

---

## NON-OBVIOUS INSIGHTS

### Insight 1: Kitchen = Moat (Not Just Feature)

**Pattern:** Yoga studios are commodity (any space works). Commercial kitchens are scarce (health regulations, equipment, insurance).

**Why this matters:**
- Baking instructors URGENTLY need kitchen access (can't scale in home kitchen)
- HB can charge premium for kitchen venue (vs commodity yoga studio pricing)
- Harder for competitors to replicate (not every venue has commercial kitchen)

**Revenue impact:** £750-£1,020 per workshop vs £500-£600 yoga

---

### Insight 2: Exa's Strength = Semantic Keywords, Not Complex Logic

**Pattern:** Too many criteria = "unclear" results. Simple criteria = "match" results.

**Why this matters:**
- Exa is neural search (finds semantic matches), not boolean filter (AND/OR/NOT logic)
- Works best with 2-3 strong criteria (location, topic, follower count)
- Can't reliably verify absence ("does NOT own kitchen") from bio text alone

**Learning:** Let Exa do semantic matching (find baking instructors), let human do boolean logic (skip if owns bakery).

---

### Insight 3: Manual Filter = 10 Minutes, Not Hours

**Pattern:** User's first instinct was "more criteria = better results." Reality: more criteria = more "unclear" = wasted credits.

**Better approach:**
- Exa finds 30 accounts (2 minutes, $X credits)
- Human filters 30 bios (10 minutes, free)
- Output: 15-20 qualified leads (total time: 12 minutes)

**Lesson:** Don't over-engineer AI search. Use AI for what it's good at (semantic matching), use human for quick judgment calls (owns bakery? yes/no).

---

### Insight 4: Sourdough = Hot Market Right Now

**Context:** Sourdough baking exploded during COVID, still strong in 2024-2026.

**Why this ICP works:**
- High demand for sourdough workshops (trendy, Instagram-friendly, skill-intensive)
- Instructors have engaged audiences (2K-20K followers = proof of demand)
- Workshops are 3-4 hours (higher price point than 1-hour yoga class)
- Can run multiple formats (beginner sourdough, advanced scoring, overnight fermentation)

**Alternative verticals if sourdough saturated:**
- Pastry (croissants, tarts - technical skill, high demand)
- Pasta (fresh pasta, ravioli - hands-on, Instagram-friendly)
- International cuisine (Thai, Japanese, Italian - cultural authenticity sells)

---

## CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

### Challenge 1: Too Many Exa Criteria = "Unclear" Results

**Problem:** User's first search had 5+ criteria → Most results "Unclear" → Wasted credits

**Screenshot evidence:** Results table showed "Match" for follower count, "Unclear" for most other criteria

**Root cause:** Exa can't verify complex criteria from Instagram profiles (e.g., "does not own commercial kitchen" - not always stated in bio)

**Solution:** Simplify to 2-3 verifiable criteria (location, topic, followers), manual filter the rest

---

### Challenge 2: Yoga ICP vs Baking ICP

**Initial assumption:** Yoga instructors need studio space → HB can provide

**User correction:** "HB has fully integrated kitchen. I think we can go for better ICP. Bakers for example."

**Why this matters:** Kitchen is RARE (not every venue has commercial kitchen). Yoga studio is COMMODITY (any clean space works).

**Result:** Pivoted from yoga to sourdough/baking (better fit for HB's differentiator)

---

## PATTERNS OBSERVED

### Pattern 1: Asset-Based ICP Selection

**Observation:** HB's kitchen = rare asset → Target customers who urgently need kitchens (not just "want studio space")

**Application:** When defining ICP, start with "What unique asset do we have?" then ask "Who urgently needs this?"

**Example:** Yoga studio (commodity) → Any instructor works. Commercial kitchen (scarce) → Only bakers/cooking instructors need this.

---

### Pattern 2: AI Search = Semantic Matching, Not Boolean Logic

**Observation:** Exa performs best with natural language keywords (2-3 strong criteria), not complex boolean filters

**Why:** Neural search finds semantic matches (understands "sourdough baking instructor" context), but struggles with absence logic ("does NOT own bakery")

**Lesson:** Use AI for pattern matching, use human for quick filters

---

### Pattern 3: Manual Filter Often Faster Than Over-Engineering AI

**Observation:** 30 seconds × 20 accounts = 10 minutes (manual bio scan) vs trying to engineer perfect AI query for hours

**Lesson:** Don't spend 2 hours perfecting AI query to save 10 minutes of manual work. Just run simple query, filter manually.

---

## META

**What went well:**
- ✅ User spotted better ICP (baking vs yoga) based on HB's kitchen asset
- ✅ Identified Exa's limitation (too many criteria = "unclear" results) from screenshot evidence
- ✅ Simplified search strategy (2-3 criteria + manual filter = faster, cheaper, better)

**What could improve:**
- ⚠️ Should have researched Exa's capabilities FIRST (before suggesting complex query)
- ⚠️ Initial yoga ICP missed HB's key differentiator (commercial kitchen)

**Process improvement:**
- When user has unique asset (kitchen, specific equipment, location), design ICP around THAT (not generic "workshop instructors")
- For AI search tools, test simple query first, add complexity only if results insufficient

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. **Run Exa sourdough search** (5 min) - Get 20-30 results
2. **Manual filter** (10 min) - Keep 15-20 who don't own kitchen
3. **Build CSV** (15 min) - Name, handle, followers, workshop type, notes
4. **Write IG outreach templates** (30 min) - 3 variations for Rochelle
5. **Hand off to Rochelle** - She sends from HB IG, tracks responses
