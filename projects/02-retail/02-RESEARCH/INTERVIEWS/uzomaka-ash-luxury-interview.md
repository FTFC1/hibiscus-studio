## Interview Transcript

Speaker 1  0:01  
So I'm just doing a test to make sure that this is working in real time. And we have uzamaka here, who is the head of sales at ash luxury, and she's going to go through the interview questions. The format will be, I would ask the questions, and then she will just talk in an open ended manner and give her own responses. So we start now. So Uzo Maka on the current team performance and skills. What sales techniques do your team use most often? We have some options on the screen about upselling, cross selling, suggestive selling, none. But what do you think? Okay, thank you, Mr.

Speaker 2  0:47  
Tina, for this question, how it works for South Africa. Choose that I manage it. I would say all of the above. And why I say this is because, for the team, some of them have strength, you know, strength and weaknesses. For this question, I say that three parts of the team have, you know, strengthened up selling, cross selling and suggestive selling, inclusive of these three parts, you know, one of the parts also carry strength in doing all of the three. So I have some of my teammates who do well in upselling. This is because when customers walk in, you know, and they even have to sell through their phones, which they do via WhatsApp, I get to see them, doing much more, trying to push the higher end brands first before the lower end brands. I also get to see them trying to say, You know what you want, this t shirt, but I know that you know, this pants will go with it. You didn't suggest this fine before, sir, but I know that this will go with it. You can trust me with this. You know, pair it and say, sometimes, most of the time, they have to send a photo, you know, of this cheese tea and pants being paired. I I also see them, you know, trying to suggest styling for the customers. So most times, customers come and say, You know what, I want to go to the beach. I have this party on Friday, but I don't know what to wear. Can you suggest, you know, something for me to, you know, to wear, and I see them, you know, having strength in doing that, to suggest the person, okay, this. And how I know that this is working is because we get feedback from the customers. They come back, you know, really, you know, after three weeks after we want to say thank you to that sales associate.

Speaker 1  2:43  
Okay, perfect. Thank you. So on the second question from one to 10, how confident are your staff when talking about prices with customers?

Speaker 2  2:55  
Okay, so for pricing, right? We are not, it's not the first thing we discuss with the customer most of the time. You know, the confidence starts from when we we try to make sure that the customer is comfortable. And by doing this, you know, we break the ice clinic into like that, we get customer comfortable. Because especially moving customers, if you know, for our existing customers, because we already know their size, because we already know what they like, because we already know, you know, pricing with them comes not immediately, but in the middle. You know, it becomes faster with the existing customers and our new customers. So for our new customers, we don't, we might not even get to speak about the price, even, you know, while the customer is still in the store, sometimes we want them to come back, you know, feel the experience first, and then, you know, you can come back to us and say, You know what? Okay, all those items you showed me, you know, I'm interested in this one. I'm interested in that one. And even when we're communicating the price, we're trying to do it, you know, based on the features and benefits of that program. So we don't go, this is the price. We go, Okay, this is the, you know, benefit you get. This is the feature of this. And because of this, this is exclusively priced at this. So price comes in last,

Speaker 1  4:08  
very, very much over the last. So you're not very confident about talking about price. Rather, you're more confident about talking about features, benefits, yes,

Speaker 2  4:17  
because we have to sell the dream first. Yeah. So it's not, it's not really that we're not confident. We get confident when it's time for it. But yeah, the discussion with the customer drives us to that place where we can now, you know, confident because we have settled benefits, because we have settled the features, because we have given the customers to trust that, you know, that value is good for the money. We get confident at that point. So I'd say, you know, whenever we get to price, we're only only nine, nine. Yeah, we're only nine at that point. Yes.

Speaker 1  4:49  
So next question, tell us about a time when a staff member handed the customer really, well, what, what and what was it effective?

Speaker 2  4:57  
Okay, great. So I'll tell you. Okay, so this is not really about only one staff. How it works for us is that when we see that, you know, one staff is pushing, you know, with a particular clients, especially our private customers or our premium customers, you know, what we do is we try to support that stuff for those, for the um sales associates that are not very busy, or, you know, have anything in your hands, they, you know, we go to support that stuff. So what we do is, we, we caress their egos. First, of course, especially if it's, you know, it's celebrity, or if it's someone well known, you know, cares their egos. We tell them about we quickly, you know, Google them. Check what they just done recently. So we dwell on that, you know? We say, oh, you know that that show you did last time was awesome. Look at the crowd, you know, I don't think any other celebrity has put that kind of crowd. So what we do that, that's what we do first. So we we it also creates confidence for that particular sales associates that's connected with customer. When I say connected with customer, that account first, you know, the salesperson, human interest. So it just gives that person, you know, leeway to now, you know, enter into the customers and emotions. So I think that that's basically it. It's always been effective. It always works.

Speaker 1  6:13  
Okay? It's always 100% so basically getting the customers information, understanding what they've been up to recently Yes, and then using that information to influence the buyer? Yes, yes, yes. How many of your teams struggle to turn browsers into buyers? You have some options on the screen from very few to almost all. Okay, so

Speaker 2  6:38  
I'll say very few. Why I say this is because I have some older stuff. You know, the older staff in my team is more than the ones that, you know, I'd say, I mean, so I'll take, I'll take very few. And when I say this, I'm saying like a three over seven, a three over 10. Sorry, out of the 10, like maybe three. And it's progressing. So it's a struggle in the in the beginning, but it progresses fast because of the fact that the older ones, you know, try to pull them up right? So it progresses. So I'll say three, I'll say very few. I'll say very few, yes,

Speaker 1  7:11  
but a few until they progress. Why do you think it happens? Why do you think they struggle to convert those buyers into buy brand browsers, into buyers initially?

Speaker 2  7:19  
Okay, so some of them may not be coming from this part of business. When I say, you know, some of them are even brand new, like they haven't done sales at all. So they, first of all, they have to learn skills to doing this. It's a skill. It's a skill to, actually, you know, have browse somebody. It's a skill to, it's, it's basically, it's a skill to be such an individual, because most times even the browsers don't give you full detail. So it's getting some of it and then asking about them, you know, and then now, you know, trying to see what they would like, or trying to see how you can contact them and all of them. So that's why I say that. So the journey between that and when we now get it right, it's shocked most of the time, because what we're doing is our business sells the 1% of the 1% so it's not really a lot, a lot, a lot of people like that, right, especially when they want to start being most of the new stuff that we have, because they've seen, you know, what the older staffs do, because they've seen how they, you know, converted to make, you know their daily targets. They also want they look big. They want to do it. So it takes a very short, it takes a very

Speaker 1  8:31  
short, short term, yeah. Okay, very clear. So now moving on to the next set of questions about knowledge gaps and daily challenges. The next question you have is, what which product details do staff avoid talking about because they don't know enough? Is it product features, pricing, promotions, returns, policy, stock availability, or care instructions, or anything else?

Speaker 2  8:59  
I think I'll bring it down to K instructions. Most of the time it's K instructions and routine. That's actually because not many of us would attack and most of the time we assume you wash with cold water, or Nigerians, but some of them are really sensitive. So it has to be hot water, it has to be liquid, so it cannot be powders, all of that, you know. So I think that's where most of the sales associates, you know fault. They have that fault, right? Because already the product features are features that, even if they don't know it immediately, they hear their teammates saying it. So most of the people, yeah, they pick up facts with that for the pricing, of course, to make it there, most times it's logged in, you know, into the sales dashboard, the promotions, of course, with the liaison we have with marketing, you know, with that buyer, and all of that, promotions are always It's either there or it's Not there. They always know from its own policy, yes, so I'll say, I take care.

Speaker 1  10:10  
So what are the three top three customer objections your team struggles with? We have the options on the screen from price to product availability, trust, urgency, quality concerns, comparison shopping, or other things as well. Okay,

Speaker 2  10:27  
price, comparison shopping,

Unknown Speaker  10:31  
definitely, yeah, because

Speaker 2  10:33  
of the environment that we're in, the environment that we're creating right now, and multi way known, if you start from beginning to the end, you'll see that stores like us, yeah, urgency. Well, we get that a lot, but most times we meet up with urgency, if, if and when we don't. There's always that polite feedback, you know, that covers, I don't know, the customers, annoyance and all of that. So I'll say price Okay. I'd say comparison shopping, and I'll see. I think those two really from this breakdown, because if we look at product availability, most of the time, there's always there's always an option, there's always an option. So, yeah, we don't really struggle with that based on the fact that so far, it's a new associate informing the older one, or informing me that, look, we don't have this product that the customer desires. But however this can go, what do you think I can say to the customer to be able to have him move from, you know, what he wants to what is yes. Then for trust, of course, I explained to you how it's in our duty to make sure that we get customers comfortable that is always covered. So I say, I say price, you know, urgencies, sometimes maybe, and then Perfect.

Speaker 1  12:02  
Thank you. What tasks take your sales staff away from helping customers, and we have the option stock, checks, paperwork, admin tasks, cleaning, training or just going on breaks and discussions.

Speaker 2  12:18  
Okay, so one of them is not here, and that's the ad hoc that we have, preparing desks, preparing pictures, and, you know, videos is in here. Maybe I'll put it on that paper under the paperwork, yes. So I think paperwork basically, and, and maybe, in fact, not maybe, most of the time having to this, been to the speed with which the inventory team has to search for products and rules. And when they're inpatient, they go themselves. So that alone is a journey on its own. Back off, you know, and be sure that, because it's the same person doing it's the person who's in ventures, basically coming back up to serve the customers. But in between, you know, we have somebody who also engages the person as well. So I'll put, I'll put that on that paperwork, yeah, and the inventory movement when, you know it's, it's, it's needed, okay, yeah, I think I'll put that under that.

Speaker 1  13:21  
So how often do you as the lead step in to help with basic customer questions?

Speaker 2  13:28  
Okay, so say often, because there's always something. There's always something every day. So you're asked for me, and I told you I was coming, that's because I was sorting, right? So there's always something big or small, you know, meet, meet, the need or whatever. There's always something, so I'd say often, often.

Speaker 1  13:51  
Now on, the next section is about training preferences. So the question you have is rank these training types, from what you think will work best for your team to least effective. And the options are short, mobile lessons, in person, workshops, written guides or voice coaching. So from the most effective they think to the least effective. Okay, so

Speaker 2  14:15  
short mobile definitely, because most times they are open to or rather, they have this skill of having multiple ears. Let me put it like that, so even if you know they're not seeing you, but they're hearing you, and they can also type, maybe do something while you're speaking. It doesn't mean they're not concentrating on what you're saying, but it means that they can actually do that. Domain. So short, mobile first, voice coaching first, definitely right in person workshop and meeting guys most times, if you write a lot, then you post them. So

Speaker 1  14:55  
I agree. So definitely short mobile lessons and then voice coaching. Okay, that's good. What's the longest time staff will realistically spend on training during work hours,

Speaker 2  15:09  
during work hours. So if I may say, it depends on the day of the week. Because, yeah, there are some days of the week that are very serious for us. So if we're looking at an example here, which is our short then I'll take, I'd say, 20 minutes on a Monday and Tuesday right now. Just leave it for 15 minutes on every other thing. 20 minutes on a Monday on Tuesday, perfect.

Speaker 1  15:37  
Okay, so at least that already means that whatever training we're trying to do has to be short snippets that they can do frequently, rather than a two hour

Unknown Speaker  15:46  
thing. Yes, definitely, definitely,

Speaker 1  15:49  
which training method works best with your current team. So watching experienced staff by observation manager, feedback, practice conversations like role plays, group discussions, written materials for others. Is it on the scale? No, just which ones you think, maybe one or two that I think are really effective.

Unknown Speaker  16:12  
Okay, so practice conversations, of course, role

Unknown Speaker  16:18  
plays. Role plays for

Speaker 2  16:20  
us, especially when we're imitating both friendly and unfriendly customers. Manager feedback, definitely my, my, you know, my colleagues have grown with, you know, the one on one coaching that we've done in the in the past time that we've been together, um, group discussions. Definitely, we have this too. So sometimes we will call out you know one another. It's agreed that we do this, because if we don't do this, then they don't know when, they don't know why, they don't know how. So most times real life experiences that happen to you know us as a group, this works for us. Yeah. So those three definitely written materials. We could do this maybe, if you know the person, even when, maybe when the person only, but even when they are off duty. Meeting materials, that's like off of

Speaker 1  17:15  
how much work time can staff realistically spend on training in a month about in a whole month, maybe three to four hours, five to six hours, above seven hours.

Speaker 2  17:29  
So if we're thinking of daily, right, we have 30 more days, of course, ideally. Now, if you say stop, you mean my team, yeah, moderate, moderate, five to six hours. Yes, they'll always tell you how there's some there has to be some time for themselves too. So I think that's I'll take more drinks. Five

Speaker 1  17:56  
to six hours of training the month is fine. So now the next section is on technology and resources. Do staff have access to devices for work or training? So is it that they have their own devices, personal and Web Devices, like iPad tablet, or the company provides all the devices they use, or some people are sharing devices, or they don't even are not even allow to use any devices doing work. Okay?

Speaker 2  18:25  
So everyone has their own phones. Of course, they're allowed to use it. And then, of course, the company provides

Speaker 1  18:36  
and what makes mobile training difficult? What do you think, even if you've not done it right now, but if you wanted to do what? Do, what do you think would be the challenge would be the data costs or internet connection? If there's one of the issues in the store, or not enough devices, or they'll just be resistant, or they don't really foresee any real issues with mobile training,

Speaker 2  18:58  
okay, so with my team, you get them 100% when they're physically with you. They start from there, so, but that's not even part of the choice here. But I think they have to be with you. And of course, data cost, of course, if they're not with you, then they tell you, how do you expect them to use their money? You know, for this? You know, it depends on how long. If it's a 10 minutes in five to 10 minutes of training or mobile experience, anything you want them to have, they can easily do it, though. But if it goes beyond that, then to start, oh no, this is way of the agreement and all of that. But then again, you have to get them in person to use. So five to 10 minutes, maybe not. You don't need them really in person to admit to it, but when it's more than that, then you you need to get the attention.

Speaker 1  19:48  
Yes. So just, I'm going to debate a bit quickly, just to expand on this point you raised. Because, as you're saying in the picture, I would imagine for what might be ideal for this environment, for example, would be we have a mobile app or something that these team members can watch five to 10 minute videos ahead of the day. Maybe, for example, you elect three days a week for training in store. So we know Monday being the first day of the week. Maybe there's training that day. So in your own spare time, maybe your way into the office, in your Uber whatever. You watch the 10 minute video, then you come into work, and because you said you need them physically together, and discussions make a lot of sense. Yes, we bring them together. They discuss what they had watched. Yes, what they understood the role play it Yes. Then, in a way, the manager then maybe goes back on the app to evaluate that each person has done,

Speaker 2  20:48  
yes, yes, that, that that is, in fact, that's the ideal force. So you're telling them, okay, you know what, on your way to work, do this terminus, right? And because you have to do this, and I'm going to spoil you. So if you're actually telling for my team members, if you're actually telling them, please, they take it seriously and they do it right. So you tell them, why even going to discuss it as you go, and I'll need you to be at your optimal you know, performance. Sometimes I throw in for the old ones. I say because you're older and, you know, that much more from you. I need you to support me. I put it like that most of the time so it can work. Yes, that that's, that's actually, that's actually the idea. Yeah, that's actually.

Speaker 1  21:36  
So just going back to the questions, the next question were number 15. Now, which training formats don't work well with your team? I think we kind of touched on this a bit before, but again, the question of answers are text, video, audio, new life, examples, interactive exercises, or none of these are problematic. 2345, different the ones that won't

Speaker 2  22:00  
work one and one, no, just one, two. Text, really text, yeah, just text, text, text, really long documents. Text has no no that. Okay, not that they won't read it, but you won't get much of what you want from them. Yeah, it's the one that is

Speaker 1  22:22  
out. Very clear. So on the second to the last section, and this is only some behavior change and results, so which sales numbers matter most day to day in the store? So because if you were, if we're going to track the effectiveness of training, I'm sure the training will need to see outputs of what they're doing. Yes. So in this store, what would you be looking at almost daily that will be most important, like basket size, conversion rates, loyalty, sign ups, average sale value, units per transaction, or even just meeting their weekly or daily targets. It's all available, really

Speaker 2  22:58  
for us, because we all these parameters are our KPIs. They're the ones that face us every day. So it's, you know, we have that data. First of all, it starts with data. What? What do we need to bring to be able to add up, you know, for us to do well, you know? Then it's also, how many of this, you know, how many items you need really need to sell to be able to even get this value right, and for us to be able to deplete the inventory right as as quickly as possible. And of course, the ACV, it's very important right for every you know sales associates to know how they're doing, you know, based on what they're selling, based

Speaker 2  23:45  
on the based on spend customer. It's very important here, loyalty sign up. Yes, we this. This isn't really strong for us right now, because we don't have we're not set up yet. Yes, we don't have an idea for this. Of course, conversion rates. This is really what says, okay, 10 customers have come. Did you convert only 10? Why did you convert only eight? What happened to you know that remaining Right? So there's always questions around this and the reasons for it, which is very important to the business, not just even to us. So commercial rate, and then the basket size, you know, even very mean, because the basket size suggests, you know, how we even give to our customers when, when it's time for gifting. The basket size suggests how we grade our customers. So you know, which ones are we putting on the high end. It's all of the above. Yeah, very

Speaker 1  24:47  
clear. So this next one is really on the effectiveness of previous training that has happened, so you've obviously done many, many trainings, was there's anyone that you can just think about that maybe you saw that improvement the most. Can you just like, What? What improved? What changed? How did you carry on that improvement, making sure that they kept reinforcing that good behavior, really? And Yeah, can you just talk about

Speaker 2  25:20  
so it's a mix of trainings that we've had from external trainers and trainings that we've had in the store like internally, right? So I'll have you know that my team members right now were not like this. When we initially began this journey, they were not like this. Most of the time I had, I even had other units, you know, come to me to say, Oh, this member of your team is not, you know, is unruly. This member of your team is doing this. This member and I have had that same conversation a few months after to say, oh, there's improvement on this, you know, particular, you know person, or this particular sales associate, or this you know group of associates, you know. So it's, it's more of the behavioral part of the training. So we've seen where even sales associates are picking up on the competition. Isn't for competition. Competition wise, the competition is very it's healthy. It's not where you find sales associates hating each other because the day before one person did better than the other. We've seen scenarios where they never used to support each other, for instance. But closing as a team, and some people haven't met, you know the threshold for the sales associates, revenue performance. You see some you see one of them support. You see them supporting each other. Okay, I'll give you 300 here. I'll give it to already adjust the power of support you have. So it's been like that. There's been so much improvement, so so much improvement in the

Speaker 1  27:07  
past. Thank you. Thank you. So which old habits are the hardest for the team to change, at least very interesting to learn from you. So we have options of they don't approach customers.

Speaker 2  27:23  
Guys, especially for in store experience, and especially now that the point of entry is far away from where they sit, because before you should be shot closer. So right now, yes, what number one is there still there was still battling customers first. So now what we suffer is the customer already gets to meet meet points before that person you know, close up with the customer. So that's there not following up on after sale. Um, I'll say 50% here, because it's only when the customer actually has a problem that you see them telling you about a Celia that includes following when, when you say it's smooth and fine, they don't follow. No, I wouldn't say they do. I think it's not just our business. Most business about this particular novel. It's a problem for me too. Yeah, not using suggested selling faces,

Speaker 1  28:31  
yeah. So, you know, especially for you, it's important, because you have a lot of scripts that you you've given to the team over time. I know you tell them a manner of speak. You try and tell them speak in a certain way. Yes, but like you said, have new members of the team, people who haven't even worked in luxury. Do they? You give them the script, but they may not even use that script for a bit.

Speaker 3  28:53  
Go back to their old ways. So do you still see that? Yes, yeah, it happens.

Speaker 2  29:00  
Yeah, yeah. That's because, for these new members, they're not yet immersed. First of all, they might not be coming from this space of luxury like you just mentioned now. So it's really, it's not impossible. I don't see anything impossible. Really. I'm one that, you know, I believe in positivity and I believe in time, right? Everybody learns in a certain way. But this is possible, very possible. It happens you still have a filter. Now, yeah, we're working on this. We're still working on it, but

Speaker 1  29:35  
building rapport with customers, that's also something that you think that they some people struggle.

Speaker 2  29:43  
Well out of 10, I'd say one, really, for this, yeah, for this, there's something about the uniqueness of the team I manage, and there's something about our customers too. I think it's really a handshake, you know, there, yeah, we have those kind of customers are laid back, you know, if you come to them in their own way, like they accept it. So it works, it works. And my team is very sensitive. So we know when to do this. We know when to attack customers, you know, just the way they are. We know when to soft pedal on the over, over top rates, you know? Yeah, so it doesn't this. This one we hold we're FEM on this one. We're not shaking here. Okay, so

---

## PART 2: Training Completion & Application

Speaker 1  0:00  
Yeah. So now in the final part of the conversation, we're just talking about what would make your team most likely to complete and apply training. And the options we have are, you know, immediate practical application recognition and reward, you know, rewarding them for completing the training, clear connection to sales performance. Is it that, if they're seeing, how does the training impacts their sales? Is it peer support and accountability, or management support even, and follow up, which I think you've also spoken about, and then fun and engaging content? Is it all of this, or is there even anything else that we've not spoken definitely. I

Unknown Speaker  0:47  
think all of this just, he just does

Speaker 1  0:56  
it Okay, perfect. I think that's the end of the feedback sessions I might have gone through everything and then open ended points you might want to share, especially as we're trying to build this training solution like you know, in terms of any gaps you think we've not identified or spoken about, or just anything that would be really important for the training to do, or issues that you should speak to, or in a certain way the training should happen. Just from your experience, obviously. What would you have anything to do for us? Feedback, yeah. So I think

Speaker 2  1:33  
this is good, this. This really covers, you know, most of it, because it's touching to this kind of thing. If I will start like that. How the training go? You know, what? What would be the convenient time for this training can happen? What? What? What days you know, this training should happen? How many hours in the month, you know, because it's good that is specified to this, you know, to the person who's going to receive this training. When you say, okay, in a month, you're going to cover between five to six hours every day. Oh, sorry. Then it means you're telling me, I can do this training. I can even say another thing we should add there. You can do it anytime

Speaker 1  2:16  
in the Yes, self paced. You
