I see I'm sensitive.

Oluseyi Falodun  6:58  
All right, Click kill on it. I'm joined now.

Timilehin Tikolo  7:55  
I,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  7:58  
yes, okay, yes, yes, okay, okay, all right. Good morning. My name is so I'm partners with timile on this project, and as you said before, we're doing some initial research to help inform that we're building something that is actually solving a challenge, and not just, you know, packaging. Okay, I have you doing and sharing my screen and then just going through questions. We have 20 Questions, but they don't all require the same level of detail, so I'll try to move quickly through the quicker ones or the more precise ones, and then I will essentially give you the floor for the open ended question. Okay, before I start, do you have any you have any questions?

Oluseyi Falodun  9:01  
Um, no, will you, will I read the question on the screen? Or you read it out today? Because I can assist questions.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  9:10  
I mean, yeah, I can ask you the question,

Oluseyi Falodun  9:12  
okay, okay, that's fine. No other questions. Fine,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  9:18  
amazing. Okay, so let's begin Question number one, could you tell us a bit about what sales technique your team uses most often?

Oluseyi Falodun  9:29  
All right, now I think the major sales technique, upselling and cross selling usually can work mostly in retail. So for instance, upselling is trying to sell more expensive products. When a customer asks for options, you know, when they come in, we can actually just tell them by gauging on the customer. I can look at the customer say, You know what? We can sell you a more expensive shoe. Because I think customer can, can afford it. I think the most important one actually is cross selling. Because mostly when we do buys, we do buy such that we buy products in storytelling, so across, across retail. So most times when a customer is ready to either pick a shoe, we suggest a matching, matching bag, or likewise as well. So I think cross selling is one very important sales technique that my team using in retail generally.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  10:27  
Okay, no problem. One, one question, quickly you so you said cross selling is that across all of the brands, or this vary from brand to brand? Yes.

Oluseyi Falodun  10:36  
So cross selling, I think, is generally across all brands. So usually, most brands don't sell only one one specific item. I think in fashion, retail usually is around buying multiple products to be able to cater for different needs. So in retail, storytelling is like a buying option, as where you're buying, for instance, to mannequin is wearing an outfit, so the top, the short, the the shoes or the band, depending. So I think across multiple retail, retail brands and store, I think cross selling is a is a very good technique, okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  11:15  
just to confirm, so you're saying that the way in which cross selling is done, for example, for June, it's still similar to how it's done for Levi's, yes.

Oluseyi Falodun  11:24  
So in a dune London store, we've got like a matching shoe with a matching bag. In Levi's, for instance, we have like a print, a t shirt print that matches, like the jean for instance. So yeah, it's, there's similarities, and there's, there's, there's, yeah, there's similarity. So the colour way as well, for instance. So in a Levi's store, do those jeans, for instance, or trouser pants, for instance, when Levi's, you find trouser pants that actually have similar patterns to the top as well, and sometimes there's a colorway that matches the shoe. So yeah, I think cross selling in a unique is similar across across multiple brands.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  12:03  
Okay, no problem. Thank you. So question two, this one's more of an open ended one on a scale of one to 10. So 10 being fantastic, one being very bad. How confident are your staff when talking about prices with customers?

Oluseyi Falodun  12:21  
I would say, I think it varies from staff to staff. Okay, on the average, I'll I'll pick like five sale between one to 10. I don't think a lot of a lot of staff actually last confident about talking about prices more so due to the devaluation that's happened in recent and recent times, you know. So price have become a very sensitive subject with customer and stuff alike. And it's always very difficult for staff to able to read, to explain to customer white on price point as on certain ways, you know. So, yeah, so I would say phase i Five is a lot. Is an aspect where a lot of training can be done, right

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  13:03  
if, obviously, five is exactly in the middle, and you're saying that it is also big part to do with the evaluation of the naira. So my follow up question is, if we were to not the devaluation of the naira. What would you store rate the team so, less about the the economy that affects everyone, and more about the specifics of the store.

Oluseyi Falodun  13:35  
Okay, so, so I would say, I would say, if we remove the devaluation of the naira, I would say between six and seven, because the staff are a lot more confident to be able to express why certain products are certain prices. So I think there's a there's a there's a close, there's a close, there's a closer, it's closer. I mean, let me explain like this. So with prices, part of staff training, product training has to be price point as well, where you're able to explain to a customer why a certain price is more expensive than another price. So most time we spend a lot of time training this stuff to understand the uniqueness of different products, we're able to say, You know what, there's a reason why this particular product is a 200,000 Naira and the other one is slightly higher from a price point. So I think a good, good staff training, which always do, will help them to be able to be confident when talking about prices for customers.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  14:29  
Okay, so, so I'm understanding what you're saying is that your confidence in your staff to talk about prices goes up with how much they care about the product. Yes. Okay, no problem. Okay, fantastic, okay. Question three, which product details do staff avoid talking about because they don't know enough options there.

Oluseyi Falodun  14:58  
Sorry, can you see? Yes, I can. I can see the options. I can see the options. Feature prices, promotion, um, from all these options, the the the one that staff will probably try avoid talking about are more of the product feature, you know, from out. Do you mind if I talk through the rest of them as well? Go ahead. Yeah. So for the pricing, it's pretty it's pretty easy to explain what the price of a product is, or even product is being discounted or not, or current promotions being offered on the product as well. And with the reform policy, there's a policy that clearly that is different from company to company, but two weeks in resellable condition, usually the policy within, within where I work, availability and alternative are quite easy to do as well, because they are familiar with options. And I think the first one and the last one, the product feature and the care instruction and maintenance are some things that the staff would would want to improve on. You know, in customer services, are particular areas where we expect the the staff to be able to touch on, usually almost garments, this instruction on those garments, around our care instruction and the future of the product. So the features you need to be more a lot more training for the staff to actually understand it. And also it varies from brand to brand. Some brand you don't need a lot of the product feature in as much as other brands. So I think when it comes to product features and care instruction is more important around the garment coming by brand as well. So a lot of staff don't really know much about this information. I think there's a lot we can do to improve them, improve the staff, to be able to understand what needs to be said and what needs to be

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  16:55  
done. Awesome. Okay, no problem. Thank you so much for the detailed answer. Let's move on. So this, this next section and the subsequent section, they have titles to kind of frame how we're thinking about these questions. This one is on manager evaluation capability. Okay, so this question is, how confident are you in evaluating sales performance, objectively? So we're saying scale of one to 1010, being amazing again, we have here, so there's probably some time you had to evaluate staff member. How do you decide if they were doing? Well, okay, so this second part is more like a helper part, if you're not sure. But let's start with this first part. How? How confident are you at evaluating sales performance objectively,

Oluseyi Falodun  17:44  
personally? Yes, I'm very confident in evaluating stuff performance objectively. Yes, but should I speak more generally, or I talk about myself?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  17:56  
No, no, you can you So, okay, I think it's probably best to quickly speak about yourself and the scenario, and then speak in a general scenario. So, yeah, okay, for example, you said that you're quite confident. So I guess the example, or what, what we're looking for here is how, what is it that's making you feel that you're confident in doing it objectively? Is it that, like you guys, have a good tracking system? Is it that you are the one that oversees and updates the KPIs? You know? I mean, like, what? What is that you currently objectively manage yourselves?

Oluseyi Falodun  18:38  
Yeah, because I am more objective when I when I deal with people regarding like so in the evaluation as well, there's some there's some that are more qualitative and others are quantitative. So the qualitative one are very easy to track KPIs performances. Is it like a sales like basket value depending on what exactly KPIs metrics that is being used, but there are other ones which is more more about theory, like personality, coming to work, early, tidiness and stuff like that. Those ones can be a bit subjective, you know? So with the KP within with the numbers, well, it's pretty straightforward. The numbers are the numbers, but the more qualitative one are, the one that probably might be difficult for people to evaluate objectively.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  19:25  
Okay, okay, cool. And just quickly, what do you guys have, like, a software or a system that you use for tracking your sales team?

Oluseyi Falodun  19:34  
Oh, yeah. So we use the software for, we use the software for, for the business and Pastor as well, we have, like, we have each staff have got, like, a ID, and they sell on the other names as well. So every month for it, so every week, we can track performance by staff as well.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  19:50  
Okay, no problem. What is the name? Sorry,

Oluseyi Falodun  19:54  
QuickBooks. We use QuickBooks software.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  19:57  
You, okay? You okay? I see what you're saying. Yeah. Because invoice usually, usually

Oluseyi Falodun  20:01  
the budget and performance is store based, not, not individual based as well, most times, okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  20:10  
okay, okay, so we've done in the past

Oluseyi Falodun  20:12  
where we've used individuals, but so, so from a management perspective, we focus more on the on the collective, the store, you know. But when you drop it down to the brand and the operations, operations can now start looking into details about which staff is doing, what, which staff is not doing,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  20:31  
what? Okay, no problem. And also, from a bonus point of view, I guess, because I want us to have enough, yeah,

Oluseyi Falodun  20:37  
sorry, go on. Yeah. The bonus as well is, is collective result, the storm is target. Everybody gets the store, don't nobody gets so it's we've tried different method in the past. To be fair, where is individual baseball? We realised that it's very difficult to track individual performances and bonus structure if it's if it's not combined, you know,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  20:59  
right? Okay, no problem. I know that we were going to then go on to the general but it sounds kind of like you touched on your your individual experience and your general one. So unless, unless there's anything else, we can proceed to question five.

Oluseyi Falodun  21:16  
Yeah, I think I've done that already. Yeah. Can proceed.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  21:19  
Okay. So, so currently, how do you assess if staff members are or have truly mastered a sales school?

Oluseyi Falodun  21:31  
I think it's a combination of a lot of different things. I I personally like,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  21:38  
oh, sorry, let's do it like this. Let's pick from the options that we have for Question five, and then you can elaborate and say on any All

Oluseyi Falodun  21:45  
right, beautiful. So how do you access assess if a staff member have truly mastered watch them with customer, with 100% you know, you have to. You know, sometimes, as the leader, just be in the store. Watch them serve a customer. And after you can, you can use that as an opportunity to train at to to talk to them about what they're doing correctly and what they're not most times, after a lot of training, you can watch them serve a customer. You know for a fact that you know what this person have really, really, truly mastered, the acts of of selling as well. Ask other staff for feedback. Um, I think you can obviously this. You can ask the superior staff for feedback. For instance, you can ask the manager or the supervisor about the feedback on the sales associate as well. Those feedback are very important because many times you are not always in the store, 247, and those feedback can be very important to understand how much they've truly mastered the skill as well. Numbers don't lie to the third point, you know, if you're very good at what you do, your numbers will speak for itself. You know, it's, it's gonna be black and white, you know. So if your numbers has improved compared to to your other colleagues, it shows that, obviously, humans stood out to sell, up selling, cross selling, and then you've mastered the skill of actually, like getting the customers to buy, to buy a lot of products. So yeah, that's very important as well. Role Play is something I personally do as well. Where, where you you you actually create different scenarios after, after customer service training, you do role playing, where you create different scenarios and see how they interact within those scenarios. You know, good customer by customer, this that exchange. And it's, I think role playing is more of an opportunity to learn that and to learn and not to know whether they've learned, and to be able to understand that these are what you do certain scenarios and what you don't know. Um, yeah, I think that's

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  23:42  
it. Well, I just want to, I just want to quickly clarify a couple of things, yeah, my understanding of what you said, and you saying that if someone does role play scenarios, and yeah, so someone does it properly, when it will play somewhere you are therefore confident that they can talk to customers.

Oluseyi Falodun  24:03  
Um, many a times, yes, but role playing. Sometimes you're you're less stressed out. You're doing role play people you are comfortable and familiar with. But if you're able to put that, there's one thing for you to to understand, to do it. Doing role play, it's a good step, okay, but in real life can be a bit different. Can give you more terms the customer be more aggressive. You know, role play will not give you an idea around what to expect in real life. So, yes, it's a good test as well. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  24:29  
so if you had to pick two out of this list, which would the two be? If

Oluseyi Falodun  24:33  
I have to pick two out of this list, three mastered, I think the first one. Watch them customer for a few minutes. It's very, very important as well. How do you actually, actually master that? I think role play with my second one. No problem. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  24:54  
thank you. Yeah. Just wanted to so if you had to grade your stuff on handling customer injections, what would you look what will I look for for and then here's like a prompting case,

Oluseyi Falodun  25:13  
what specific video will you would m high or low scores? Um, is it from a from a staff perspective, right?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  25:26  
Yes. Stop, stop talking to customers or specifically on handling objections.

Oluseyi Falodun  25:32  
So, you know, from my experience, some staff don't do well handling very difficult customer. There's some customers are very, very like the first rule is very, very troublesome. They make a lot of noise. They are ready to cause around cause. So many times there are certain issues that would have been handled differently by the shop floor staff that would have been easy, but the lady escalate. Many a times you don't let escalate. I think another important, another important thing the staff, from staff handling is that I think they need to call a superior earlier than they usually do, you know. So if, within the context of the shop floor, there are certain things you cannot approve, authorise, don't say no. Most times say no, and expect the customer to just go away and let it be I think you need to. They need to escalate it. I think Am I answering a question correctly? If you have to agree your customer now, the customer objection, what will you look for? Yes,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  26:34  
just one. Yeah. What I mean is like, let's say you witness a customer, let's say this would benefit averages. So you wish you witness an someone who you think performed average in your staff team. Yeah? And you're looking at, you're looking at how they handle an objective. And let's say there was something that was glaringly obvious, like that was a very bad thing, or glaringly obvious that that was a good thing. Yeah. You know, I think what I want to do because I'm aware of the time that we have, but what I want to do is I want us to rapid fire through the questions that are all multiple choice, and then we can see how much time we have left for the other ones. Okay, that's fine. That's cool. First question, would you value retail staff who have professional certifications, whatever? There's like, level this, level that, but would you, would you value them coming to you with personal certifications? Yes,

Oluseyi Falodun  27:42  
yeah, that will yes in this, in this, yes, I will value it very, very, very, very highly. So because in this, in this market, is something that is not very popular, and then retail is not like a course or a career. People don't see retail as a career path in this side, in this I mean Nigeria generally, so it's certification, about basic training that people have done to show that it's going to go a long way, very, long way. Yeah. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  28:13  
okay. Cool. Question Nine. Do you think retail need clear career progression levels, like associate, Senior Assistant Manager,

Oluseyi Falodun  28:22  
yes, these are, these are to my fault, to my earlier answer as well. These are the reasons people don't see retail as a career as well, because there's no clear progression around, oh, after this, this, what do I become? What do I become? Because we all know it's a pyramid. There are fewer people at the top, but and then a lot of businesses don't have, like an expansion plan around, you know, how many stores are you going to have? I mean, people cater for Yeah, but I think it's very important to be able to for retention, to have those kind of clear higher progression plan as well. Okay. Oh, there are, of course there. Would that motivate? Oh, yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  28:57  
yeah. You basically said, Yes, yeah. Okay, cool. So now we're into the monthly training commitment. So could your store realistically commit to two training days per month for role play sessions? Just to clarify, these are going to be two hours max, and they're going to be led by the manager. It wouldn't be that we would be coming in and training. It's like you guys have undertaken this programme. You know that your staff are doing some kind of learning, and then you want to see that they're actually digesting, or, you know, deeply understanding, the things that they're learning. So that's why we've come up with this idea of each training session. Yeah, so thinking about it in terms of the time that you guys have available to you, the schedules that you have, and it being four hours a month that you'd have to put aside to make sure that people actually improving their sales skills. Is that something that realistically could happen?

Oluseyi Falodun  29:58  
Yes, so it depends on the timeline as well. So it's a function of where is it. Is it? Do you want to do it on the shop floor? Do you want to do it in the store? You know, if you're doing on the store, you're doing outside of opening and close, outside of opening and closing hours as well. So I think there's a lot more questions that you need to know. You know, if a store is open at nine o'clock, do you want to do one hour or two hours? Or the stock can open at 10 and start from eight to 10, or after closing out, which I think is late already Anyways, after eight o'clock, you know. Or do you want to do it in, in another space where the staff actually have their off days? Or we can say, You know what let the staff they are not working today, five, 610, of them for that training. So it's a lot more, you know, depending on on the company as well, the kind of what is workable, okay, yeah, you've mentioned here as well, easy, manageable, but would need to plan around, yeah. So it's something that needs to be planned around. You know, is, if it's on the shop floor, we can do it like we do training with our external partners. Sometimes, before the store opens, like nine, eight to nine o'clock. Sometimes you can say, You know what? Because of this doesn't happen often we can, we can open the store slightly to cater for for the role play. So, yeah, okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  31:16  
no problem. Thank you. Yeah, that makes sense. I'm gonna skip 11 for now and go to 12. So 12 is, what are your top three customer objections your team struggles with? And there's, um, there's some options here on the screen,

Oluseyi Falodun  31:29  
price, product of the trust, quality concern, comparison, um, product availability, trusts. I think, what do we what do we struggle with the most price due to? I mean, I don't want, I don't want to keep mentioning the valuation. Yeah, I think price is an option, uh, product availability. Uh, shouldn't be I think we handled that so well because of the way the buy is done. You know, product available in multiple, in sizes, and if it's not manually very well. Trust as well. Trust, you know, they keep asking, is it the real pain? You know, is it the same as what you have a boy? Find a brand thing sometimes, even sometimes, the customers, the staff, are not confident enough, you know, you know. So is it for a customer to say, you know, I be I've been to this country, that country, and then they be worried about, oh, they can't even they don't really trust what they're selling, which I think are doing.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  32:34  
Let me, let me ask you this question slightly differently, because I want you to only pick one, which out of all of these, is the biggest barrier to making a sale?

Oluseyi Falodun  32:46  
Um, biggest barrier called concern,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  32:53  
let's say outside of price. Outside of price,

Oluseyi Falodun  32:56  
the biggest barrier comparison shopping? Nah, nope, because most times, most of these products are kind of like exclusive. You can't get anywhere else, so there's no trust, quality concern our Buddh, I don't think there's any specific one that is that stands out. Okay, would

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  33:19  
you be able to say the top three

Oluseyi Falodun  33:22  
product availability, obviously that. I think probabilities are quite important as well. If there's no trust, I didn't think about it. What does it mean in the context

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  33:36  
of trust? Do you trust that this person is telling you everything you need to know in order to make purchase, or you're actually like, I'm making sure, like, I've been given everything I need to know. I need to think about it. All right? I hear that. So, yeah, I think

Oluseyi Falodun  33:52  
everyone is quite important. But I don't think there's a specific one that dies.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  33:59  
That's fine. Let's proceed. Um, question 13, so can you rank these training types from best to worst for your team? Yeah,

Oluseyi Falodun  34:09  
short, mobile lessons, in person, workshop, written guides, WhatsApp, voice coaching. I think in person is the best group training session, each person is in person, is, is clear, is clearly, clearly the best. There's a lot of benefit to it. Should I need to expire? I don't need to

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  34:30  
No, no, that's fine. So that's your number What's your number

Oluseyi Falodun  34:33  
two? Um, short mobile written guidelines, short mobiles. Listen WhatsApp, voice coaching, Voice Note with tips. What's a short mobile lessons, all the videos,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  34:50  
objection handling. And it's a video about how to handle objections in a localised way, to Nigeria, as opposed to some.

Oluseyi Falodun  34:59  
I think, I think I will go with 214, and 3214.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  35:12  
And three. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. Okay, no problem. What is the longest time staff would realistically spend on training during work. This is in a day,

Oluseyi Falodun  35:23  
in a day. You know, the truth is, there's this so we there's this analysis we did and found out that a lot of times we have a lot of stuff on the shop floor that actually not serving customer, because the customer that works with us, very, very, very, very small when we start tracking like the customer, customer walking into the store, and we realise that they have a lot of time on their hands, that literally are not doing a lot of things, just talking, just in and not, not much. So I would say realistically, we they can spend more than 20 minutes on a training during during the day.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  35:59  
Okay, nice. Okay, cool. This section is on standardisation and career development was, of course, we were tweaking it earlier, so how many of your current staff could realistically become assistant managers with proper training? And I'm going to add a caveat to this, and let's say it's in the next within this year. So we're in June now, so the next

Oluseyi Falodun  36:21  
six months, next six months, say, like end of the year,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  36:24  
yeah, how many could, could realistically become system managers with proper training, with

Oluseyi Falodun  36:32  
proper training, right? With proper training, manager, you have the upstream, yeah. Most of them, about half, some of them, very few, none of them, proper training. I would say

proper training. I would say half. You know, the reason why I'm being hesitant is is, you know, sometimes you can train and sometimes this, they don't just want to learn. You know, it's I don't know how to how to explain the they know they know the right thing sometimes, and they choose not to do even with training. So, so I think has to do with commitment as well. Commitment to improve and to learn as well. So yeah, so I think half of them with proper training. Why not?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  37:28  
Okay, cool, no problem. Then, okay. Would you prefer to evaluate staff yourself or to send video submission to training experts?

Oluseyi Falodun  37:41  
So the options are here as well, evaluate myself with clear guidelines, send videos to export for objects, object scoring combination of both. Method depends on the skill being assessed of fair. Um, fortunate. So how the how the video work, you will do a video of yourself,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  38:03  
yeah, let's say, let's say we had a module that was on objection handling, and then there was a pest. And in that test, you put your phone down and you role play or pretend, to address 2010, different objections of customers. And then that video, you could send it to your manager, and then your manager is now tasked with figuring out how to grade that person relative to all the other people. Or you could send that video to experts and they would objectively score against their database and mock scheme. I

Oluseyi Falodun  38:36  
think a combination of both methods will be best.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  38:40  
Okay, can you just, can you elaborate slightly on how you imagine a combination of both looking in your organisation?

Oluseyi Falodun  38:47  
So, for so within the organisation, if, if, if, myself, I train it, I evaluate the staff, you know, it touches, based on like, the skill being assessed as well. So if the the expert I've got like, what they're looking out for, and I can get I can have something different I'm looking out for, and there's gonna be a synergy between what I'm looking out for and what the expert is looking out for as well. So within the organisation, it's it probably will be tough, but I don't think it's impossible to be able to use. Would you rather evaluate staff yourself for send video submission to expert. So if it's easy to be able to do the videos and then to be able to sell, why not? You know, sometimes we need people from outside to see what we're not seeing as well. They're looking for me from a different what? Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  39:39  
now I'm just, I'm just, I'm just thinking, for example, for an organisation like yours, I don't know who park, how many sales people do you have across all, let's say nationally. How many sales people do you have?

Oluseyi Falodun  39:53  
Um, we have around um, say 200

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  39:58  
Okay, and then how many managers do you have?

Oluseyi Falodun  40:00  
Um, so we technically have a manager per store. So let's say we have 45 to 50 stores. So yeah, that's like 45 to 50 managers. Okay, you got 200 staff and

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  40:13  
you got 45 managers. So roughly, that's four or four sales people per manager. Yes. So then the question, if you think about it like this, right? Would a manager have enough time to watch? Let's say each person submits 110 minute video, right? So 110 minute video, and we said 4.4 that's that's roughly 45 minutes per module. Let's say they did five modules in a month. That's 200 Okay, let me just quickly. Do you think your managers, on average, can spare four hours a month to watch these videos? That's basically what it would look in house,

Oluseyi Falodun  40:58  
to be fair, putting putting in that kind of perspective, it makes it looks obviously mixed. My thinking around the different as well. Now, will somebody actually spend like, four hours, five hours a month, actually looking at videos? Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  41:13  
staff training. If you don't think so, that's fine. I just wanted to

Oluseyi Falodun  41:18  
like perspective. So, so if i Okay, so if I choose, if you evaluate, if I ever, if you evaluate them yourself, there is no need for videos, right?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  41:29  
Yeah? Well, no, no, there's still the videos just be sent to us instead of being sent to managers. Someone has to evaluate these videos. It's just, yeah,

Oluseyi Falodun  41:39  
okay, combination of both metals. So I think, yeah, I think I will choose the expert to do it. Then it's simple, okay, I think it's better for the for the for the for this, for the for the expert to actually do it. Then, okay, cool, um, how

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  41:53  
important is it? Let me do you know I think 17. We're going to scale 17 for now, which sales number matters most you day to day in your store, because these are the options basket and special

Oluseyi Falodun  42:05  
conversion loyal to sign up average sales value, daily, weekly. Personally, it depends. I mean, if I'm, if I'm being more broad, it's, it depends on what the, what the, what the what the business is looking for. But I think daily, weekly targets is the first, most important. One is the target daily, because the higher it is, it rubs off on the rest as well. Sure, basket conversion, but when you need, I think most of the other KPIs is a function of when you're not doing, when you're doing comparison, maybe another store, another, another month, another, you know, but the foundation of it is daily and weekly sales target. Okay, cool. Let

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  42:48  
me first do questions for any and then we can do a temperature check and see what we have time. So what is your biggest concern about implementing a professional certification system? Obviously, this is within your organisation. And then viewers are organisation, and then

Oluseyi Falodun  43:03  
professional certification system, time committee requires staff resistance to formal testing, my own ability to evaluate properly, disruption to daily operations, cost implication, maintaining standard consistently, I personally think, is professional certification system will very, very greatly welcome. It's something I think we lack in this market. I think a lot of companies will will be worried if the cost is too high, but it's, you know, it's an investment as well. So, yeah, I think the other I don't, the time, permitted, require, shouldn't be a problem. Staff resistance, formal test. I don't think any staff don't want to improve themselves and and test their abilities as well. My own capability to evaluate properly. I don't think that should be a problem. Instruction to daily operations. You can walk around that we've had that conversation around like, maybe an hour before opening of days and stuff like that. I think, ah, cost implication is one factor where I'm looking at I'm thinking myself that you can, you can pay for you as an associate or somebody that I try to get into it. So you can actually pay to have those certification yourself outside of the company as well. And I think the company should can go out of their way to pay for I think, I think custom education is probably one of the major concern. There's no reason why professional certification. Certification certification system is very important.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  44:24  
Cost, okay, no problem, okay, I want us. I don't want to rush us and, like, be pressed on time, because we also we have, like, back to back interview before I maybe even close or use more time. Timmy, was there anything you specifically wanted?

Timilehin Tikolo  44:48  
No, I think, I think there was one open ended question you may have skipped earlier or No, I think, wow. Probably has to be, probably be an open ended question. It might be the last question. If you don't have anything else, depends on that. But my own question is just simply, because I know she is very experienced, right? I think I won't ask a question that is not really like, what would ask anyone else, but it's more like, you know, he's done many trainings, he's overseen many trainings. He's oversees many stores. So he's his viewpoint is very different to what we get from any for most of that people, right? So see what we're trying to build. We're looking at training from the angle where we we redesign it, right? We almost put the the power in the hand of the managers. You know, when we do training, sometimes you get an instructor, or whatever, a trainer you have to rent, you have to take people out of the store. Yeah, there's so many things and like, and we don't even know if people are really taking on that behaviour or not. Yeah, they're just, you know, so for us, what we trying to do is look at how people currently consume information, which is like, for example, with social media, everybody's on their phones, 10 minute videos, five minute videos, if we're able to put training in that format, yeah, right. And then get the managers every month to assess them, like, okay, you know, you watch a video, you act out the part of your manager. Then maybe every, every six months we we administer an exam, like an independent exam, yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you Yeah? Do you think that would be where the industry and then, obviously, the idea is that people will now be getting certified. Like, let's say we can standardise industry. Say, like, as a manager, you should have, like, level seven, for example, yes, this has maybe level four, so that even if you're hiring a new manager from any other retail maybe another retail business that has this guy is also using the same Yeah, you already know this person. Yeah, it's actually quite

Oluseyi Falodun  46:58  
nice. Yeah, yeah. Do you think? What do you think? So, for me, it's just kind

Timilehin Tikolo  47:01  
of like, I don't even want even want your own opinion on I think,

Oluseyi Falodun  47:04  
I think, I think it's, it's fun, it's fun. It's a very fantastic idea. I think some brands do have it. Remember Levi's had like these models, where they go through these models and sign up across all African countries as well, this system as well, which I was involved in when they have this training. One thing that was difficult with the swatch. One is that Andre at the time the short people like, oh, this person have not completed it. Oh, it's 50% completion to make. Because I remember, I don't know that it just takes me 1520 minutes to read and click, click, click, click, click. But people are not, you know, there's nobody chasing them. And oh, out of 10, out of 20 staff, only 10 have completed the other you know, but important as well, metrics as well. And then, if that was what you were asking me earlier, or your partner was asking me earlier, about, oh, videos. And if this was what, what you explained to me, I would have said, Yes, it works right method. You know, there's no is it seamless? There's no need people to be combined together in one space. How to rent Exactly? Or they can do it their own free time. There's a test that shows that it done, yeah, is the follow through that makes me not pick it. And the option, because very people to do things for themselves. Sometimes can be tough, you know? But if you have a timeline to it and say, You know what, in two weeks you must have completed, like, let's say, stage one, there'll be like, I like that, like, a small mini exam online, yeah, oh, you need to pass over 90% of it and stuff. There's a complete, like, a top to bottom flow of hours. And then, yeah, that's, that's a very, very, very welcome development, a very good option,

Timilehin Tikolo  48:56  
right, okay? Because ultimately, and this just the final thing, ultimately, what we're trying to do, right is, like you were saying, like to standardise industry, to regulate it, so that people, you know, sales people, first of all, because that's what we're starting with. Can, obviously, we can benchmark them, we can track them. We can, you know, upgrade them. But beyond sales people, you know, you mentioned something about retailers not really having that progression as well, well, we eventually would now want to get to, is the position where we're also able to offer, like, some type of buying certification, yes, video, visual merchandising certification, so that sales people too can also see that entry retail. You don't have to be a salesperson. You can also have that, yeah, yeah, if you remember, then there's this guy

Oluseyi Falodun  49:44  
or something like, there's this guy that we had that conversation with where he was one of the only pioneers that's trying to do training for people. I really encourage him at the time, because he's a serious gap what you're doing. Is a serious gap in what you're doing in this a serious gap where people can actually, like, when you have relationships with those companies and they like, oh, yeah, you are level one, level two, level three, yeah, it saves us a lot on you we know that what level three can do, level four, and then you know that, oh, this person is level four certification. You already know that you're getting somebody that that's quality, that understand, understand customer service, understand, yeah, inducted into the business itself. But from a more general, broad knowledge, this person is the guy, yeah, okay,

Timilehin Tikolo  50:36  
no, I think that's the guarantee you've answered everything from me. Thank you so much. I don't know until I was there any other thing

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  50:44  
now answer, I guess the, the only other question we can ask you, Mr. Shay, are we okay to follow up with you as we continue to develop this?

Timilehin Tikolo  50:55  
Yeah, it's true. Like, see, like, because, obviously, yeah, that's actually true. Because the what we're trying to do now, obviously, doing all interviews, like we've been doing interviews from last week, right? Yeah, across all companies, so from luxury, like, you know, to you guys, like all sorts of people, right? But what we're doing is taking all this feedback. So this month now, we're taking all your feedback, and we're essentially using it to develop, like, let's just call it the first draft of what it might look like based on what everyone is saying. Oh, mobile first, oh videos, oh yeah, yeah. But by July, we have our own target to then have, like, some kind of draft to come back. So what we want to do is, will you be willing to still continue to support us, like in July, we'll come back and say, we say, yeah. Is it? How can we tweak we still be willing

Oluseyi Falodun  51:44  
to, yeah, because, you know, I've been in, I mean, I've been in retail industry in Nigeria for 30 years now. And I think if there's one gap which I'm happy, you're, I mean, to be your partner, you're trying to feel, because this is a huge gap in industry, you know, you know, people don't take retail as a career. Even people in retail as well, they don't have the basic fundamental understanding. I was lucky to have had an understanding when I was doing retail in the UK, training, role playing and within a team as well, and give you understanding of what you need to a lot of people were employing that don't and and then, and then, some people that have the experience that have the experience that they are coming to the organisation, they are coming with bad experience. So even many a times, I would rather employ somebody new, young, that can be as somebody that I've already got bad experience, you know? So this is a gap in the industry that you're trying to feel. I'm happy to help. Why not?

Timilehin Tikolo  52:41  
To get to the Yeah exactly, to find all the better for it. Yeah. Thank you so much.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  52:53  
Sorry. Thank you so much for your time on this holiday, and

Timilehin Tikolo  52:59  
thanks a lot. On holiday, appreciate it. All right, No worries. Bye.
