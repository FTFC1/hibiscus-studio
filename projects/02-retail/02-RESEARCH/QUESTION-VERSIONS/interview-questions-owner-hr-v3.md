# Professional Retail Certification Interview Guide v3
*Owner/HR Manager Focus - 20 Strategic Questions*

---

## **🔹 TIER 1: Core Pain Points & Product-Market Fit**
*Start here - these questions validate your core assumptions*

### **Skills & Performance Gaps**

**Q1:** What are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today? 

*Give us specific examples of situations where you've noticed these gaps affecting your business. What exactly happens when staff lack these skills?*

**Q2:** What key behaviours or competencies do you want to see consistently across all your sales associates?

*Think about your best-performing store or sales associate. What specific behaviours make them successful?*

### **Manager Capability Assessment** 

**Q3:** How confident are your store managers in evaluating staff performance objectively?

*Scale: 1 (Not confident at all) to 10 (Very confident)*

**Q4:** What's your biggest concern about relying on managers for staff evaluation?

Options:
- Inconsistent standards between managers
- Lack of evaluation skills/training  
- Personal bias affecting assessments
- Time constraints and competing priorities
- Managers being too lenient with staff

**Q5:** We've heard from other retailers that manager engagement varies by location. Do you find you trust your Lagos-based managers more than those in satellite locations when it comes to staff assessment?

*If yes: What do you think causes this difference? How does it impact your business?*

**Q6:** We've observed that some retailers implement different evaluation processes for head office vs satellite locations. To ensure uniform standards, would a third-level assessment (area manager or HR sign-off) make sense for locations outside your head office?

*This would complement your manager-led assessments for consistency.*

### **Success Metrics That Matter**

**Q7:** Which metrics matter most to your business?

Options:
- Basket size (average spend per customer)
- Conversion rate (% of visitors who buy)
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Staff retention rates
- Upselling success rate

**Q8:** Share a time when training actually improved your sales results:

*What were the specific results? How did you measure the impact?*

## **🔹 TIER 2: Certification Appetite & Investment**
*Core data collection - proceed with all qualified prospects*

### **Assessment Preferences**

**Q9:** Would you prefer objective assessments or manager-led evaluations?

Options:
- Objective evaluation (video submissions, standardised tests)
- Manager-led assessment (maintains local ownership)
- Combination of both methods

### **Industry Standardisation**

**Q10:** Do you believe the Nigerian retail industry needs standardised skill levels? 

*For example: Entry Level (Lvl 1), Sales Associate (Lvl 3), Supervisor (Lvl 6), Manager (Lvl 9)*

Options:
- Yes, absolutely - long overdue
- Yes, but implementation will be challenging  
- Somewhat - depends on structure
- Not really - current system works

**Q11:** How do you currently handle onboarding experienced staff who join from other retail companies?

*Follow-up: Would an initial skills assessment help you understand their capabilities faster?*

### **Training Investment & Content**

**Q12:** What topics would be most valuable to include in certification training?

Options:
- Product knowledge & upselling techniques
- Customer service & engagement
- Objection handling & closing sales
- Store operations & visual merchandising
- Brand values & customer experience

**Q13:** If you could only choose ONE training module to see immediate business impact, which would it be?

*Force prioritisation - no "all of the above" allowed*

**Q14:** Would you pay a premium for training customised to your brand and SOPs?

Options:
- Yes, fully customised is essential
- Partially customised (branding + some content)
- Generic content is fine
- Cost is more important than customisation

**Q15:** What's a realistic annual budget per employee for professional retail certification?

*Give us a ballpark range - we're still finalising our pricing structure.*

### **Implementation Commitment**

**Q16:** Could your organisation commit to 2 manager-led training sessions per month (2 hours max each, using our materials)?

*These would be internal sessions run by your managers, not external trainers*

Options:
- Yes, easily - we prioritise development
- Yes, with proper planning
- Possibly - depends on busy periods
- Too disruptive to operations
