## TIER 2: Certification Appetite

**Q9:** Would you prefer objective assessments or manager-led evaluations?
- Objective evaluation (video submissions, standardised tests)
- Manager-led assessment (maintains local ownership)
- Combination of both methods

**Q10:** Do you believe the Nigerian retail industry needs standardised skill levels?

- Cost is more important than customisation

**Q15:** What's a realistic annual budget per employee for professional retail certification?

**Q16:** Could you commit to 2 manager-led training sessions per month (2 hours max each)?
