## 🔹 **KEY DIFFERENCES**
*Areas where interview responses varied significantly*

### Market Size Reality Check
**International Brands May Not Pay** *(Kieran/Nike)*
- Kieran (Nike): "I'm not paying for this because I have my own model"
- Rationale: Major brands invest heavily in proprietary training systems
- However: This represents one perspective from established global brand operations
- Consider: Mid-tier and emerging brands may have different needs

**Mom & Pop Dominance** *(Kieran/Nike, Ifeoma/Adidas)*
- Nigeria's retail landscape heavily skewed to single-store operations *(Kieran/Nike)*
- Structured retail limited to 5-6 major players *(Ifeoma/Adidas)*
- Addressable market significantly smaller than initially assumed
- However: Focus shifts to quality over quantity of target customers

**Training Budget Assumptions**
- Kieran noted uncertainty about exact training budgets
- Cost sensitivity varies dramatically between operators
- ROI justification crucial for any investment decision

### Management Philosophy Approaches
**Contrasting Styles:**
- **Consequence-Based** *(Ifeoma/Adidas):* "By fire, by force" - penalties drive compliance
- **Incentive-Based** *(Kieran/Nike):* Team ownership and succession planning as motivators
- **Balanced Approach** *(Seyi/Multi-brand):* Confident in current methods but open to improvements

**Synthesis Opportunity:**
- **Baseline standards:** Consequence-based for core compliance (attendance, basic skills)
- **Growth incentives:** Incentive-based for advancement opportunities (succession, bonuses)
- **Example application:** "Must complete monthly assessments to remain employed, but top performers get fast-tracked for management roles"

### Training Time Solutions
- **Seyi (Multi-brand):** Organizing everyone into one group is difficult
- **Kieran (Nike):** Opening 1-2 hours early is viable solution  
- **Ifeoma (Adidas):** Supports hour before store opening approach but emphasises need for accountability measures

### Manager Assessment Confidence
- **High:** Seyi (Multi-brand) - "very confident in evaluating staff performance objectively"
- **Low:** Kieran (Nike) - "I don't have any faith in my guys to be objective"
- **Moderate:** Ifeoma (Adidas) - rated managers 6/10, citing skills gap not capability

### Accreditation Essential *(Kieran/Nike)*
