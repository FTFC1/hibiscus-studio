Why Nigeria &
West Africa
4
465 million youthful consumers (West Africa), double-digit retail growth, and a critical skills gap. 
1
2
Retail already contributes ~16 %
of Nigeria’s GDP yet 6 in 10
graduates lack job-ready
service skills (Jobberman,
2025).
Front-line turnover exceeds 30 %
annually; recruiters and brands
cite poor selling skills and weak
merchandising practices as top
barriers to growth.
Talent & Skills Gap

Talent Pool
Evaluation & Optimization
International brands (Tommy
Hilfiger, Lacoste, NIKE) and local
chains are scaling fast but cannot
find globally-ready talent in-
market.
Africa’s largest consumer base:
Nigeria’s population is ~237 million
(2025) and will surpass 260 million
by 2030 , with a median age 18.1
years; almost two-thirds of
Nigerians are under 25.

What we
need from
you
License your proven retail-academy IP, share
best practices and jointly take West Africa’s
fastest-growing consumer market.
Access to your core
modules (Retail Sales, CX
Excellence, Buying &
Merchandising, Inventory
Planning, Store
Leadership). 
Joint branding on
certificates, marketing
collateral, and public-
facing events. 
Share data and best
practices to continually
improve African service
standards.
Rights to localise case
studies, role-plays, and
assessments for West-
African context.
Shared thought-
leadership (white papers,
webinars) spotlighting
market insights.
Nigeria’s combination of scale, youth, and retail formalisation offers a once-in-a-generation
growth curve - but only if the industry can rapidly upskill its front-line and back-end talent.
This is the gap we can fill together.
