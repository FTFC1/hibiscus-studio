Plans and progress so far but also then maybe reach a point of collaboration at some point with LPS you know in terms of either like getting some sort of certification for the courses we're offering or just finding a way that we can collaborate because with what we're trying to do eventually we'll get to the stage where having that academic backing can be of value you know to what we're trying to do so we are exploring different academia partners and institutions but just because of the you know the relationship and actually I already have LPS through you Tony you know I thought it would be an interesting point to first of all start the engagements before we kind of you know start exploring and further field as we go along so then a quick overview and introduction that's that's um that's where we are but first of all do you have anything to add in terms of interest? Hi, good morning everybody. My name is Faye Ntola, Larry Nkoka. As Timmy has said we are trying to build a platform which both helps with training in the immediate sense for people that are on the shop floor but also training in the sense of career progression because we through a number of interviews that we've held over the past two weeks have found whether it is us speaking to very large international organizations or speaking to you know homegrown um powerhouses that have been having locations with both international and local brands across the country they've all said to us that a lot of the time they're finding that people find themselves in retail and they are instead seeing it as a job and not a career so we're trying to both internally and externally change that so that we can have both an attractive setup for brands that are no that are currently not here but also something that allows people to invest internally within their teams and allow some kind of structure for progression as opposed to this worry that do we have our pipeline filled are we able to really push people to understand the brand and once they understand the brand they're not going to join another organization a large organization or because of some incentive that they can see their peers that another organization have that they would go there instead of staying where they've received the training that these companies would partner with us to administer um another point that timmy made that i just wanted to buff is that we're we're in a research phase but due to the combination of both timmy's expertise in retail and then my expertise when it comes to a technological background we are trying to iterate very fast so a lot of the times for example we're having an interview and live within that interview we are taking our insights to then ask better questions or we are taking our interview script to then build our landing page so this is very much a co-collaboration a lot of the people that we've had our conversations with initially have already expressed interest to join our waitlist so i know one of the things was demand that you wanted to ask about so since our last conversation i think we've had now eight interviews or around yeah around that um excuse me we've had eight interviews we have iterated on a landing page we have a form we have also now discussed some other branches we've also had discussions about recruitment and how some people are even open to having the training running concurrently with almost like a recruitment placement or summer program setup so the reason why i'm kind of giving this broad outline to begin with is just so you can see what is picking your interest and also you can see the developments um tommy from when we had our first conversation i think maybe three weeks ago now thanks thanks so i mean um just for i guess for everyone especially i'm prof also for your benefit because i know in the last call with tommy we really tried to explain you know what we're doing but just to recap it so with what we're doing we're doing a retail um training or let's call it intervention program right that is split into two parts there's a part that's focused on the front facing customer facing um retail associates so you're thinking store managers sales executives um shop floor assistants and the rest of that primarily firstly based around the fashion retail sector because that's where one my expertise largely lies but two is also allows us it has the dynamism of being a fairly moderately sized industry that allows us to test and improve and refine our models until we get to a point that we can then roll it out into sort of the hospitality business which obviously has more players in there when you start looking at restaurants high-end restaurants hotels and the rest of that but right now you know we're focusing on on the fashion retail industry which as of today has a handful of very key established players you're thinking of people like persianas that manage puma lacoste businesses in nigeria and ghana you're thinking of smart mark that has tom hill figure you know and the rest of the nike players are now expanding with sports direct and a few other brands coming into nigeria there's obviously the um the brand code group that does adidas and you know havaianas so there's and then they're talking about more luxury players like polo ash luxury so there's there's already a fairly well established presence and this presence allows these brands to exist across nigeria and even into west africa so what we're trying to do is what we're doing on our own side is focusing on the shop floor teams first and trying to build a training module or program that is mobile first and allows the training to happen in in almost like a modular manner where the store managers leads those trainings in their shop floors on site using the apps that were developed to kind of track the progress so that one is what we are really strongly iterating and working on right now that one we might manage ourselves and manage internally but where we see the the potential collaboration really right now with academia is a little bit further down the line but i want to start having these conversations now just because i understand that it might take a while to cross all the t's and dot the i's further down the line because some of the feedback we've gotten already is that people don't really see retail as a career and you know i'm personally someone that has always been in retail as a career so i know you know that there are different pathways in retail there's buying there's inventory management there's merchandise and planning there's visual merchandising there's you know even performance metrics for retail performance management for retail there's so many avenues that you can grow a career in retail beyond the shop floor and for us that's what we feel like having that accreditation with or authentication with lbs would be of value because these people are not now the shop floor associates that i think managers back end you know department heads head of units chief commercial officers head of buying and the rest these are the people that would value you know a certificate obviously that shows yes they've been in the industry they've been trained you know by us but also an established institution in this case like lbs also recognizes that because then that's then there's a lot of value for them to say look i have the certificate it's this is from here and it's recognized by this body so for us that's actually what we wanted to try and talk to you about to say looking at what we're trying to do how does lbs or how can we partner with the retail academy and lbs to get those pathways certified you know not really focusing on the shop floor to the associate side of things because again those are almost the foot soldiers so they are just they need to be trained on basics of skill as basic skills of customer service you know sales um engagement but that one doesn't really need an academic uh time but further up the value chain is where we see that and that's what we wanted to you know just kind of hear from you today on if you've done anything like this before how that has worked or if you're interested in how we can maybe then build out something that can collaboratively work so professor told me that's that's what we wanted to discuss with you today great so thank you very much thank you timmy and thank you so much as well for the updates so i'll um have some questions but also give you an overview timmy is a fan of the lagos business school also the africa retail academy you have come to almost all the congresses you've been very visible so thank you for for supporting us you are the e-commerce summit so you know what we are here for what we're doing uh and by the way if you haven't come please put it on your calendar they yeah i'll be at the next one sir okay so now um what we do we do our mission as an academy is to scale up the professionalization of retail practices in africa that's what we want to achieve we want to work with stakeholders to ensure that we move from seeing retail as something that is not a carrier as some people allude to to to because paradoxically people claim it's not a career but then when we see the size of retail in africa what is contributing to gdp is paradoxical that they say that so imagine if we all put our heads together to keep that sector the attention it deserves it will go much further so that's our mission that's we're looking very closely at nigeria but our vision is beyond nigeria to to do this now um so we do this through research we do this through capacity building uh programs that we run we do this especially through thought leadership series the congresses the fora the affinity groups and all those uh we've done a little bit of policy work but you know as you know anything policy with government some time so we're still on that journey and we've done a bit of coaching and mentorship as well for people we launched an advisory service recently so this uh just trying to see what works and the response from the market has been very very good i mean people are very excited people are committed passionate about this and also the reason is we're not just seeing retail as being sectoral and not seeing retail as a sector alone we're seeing retail as a way of doing business a way of ensuring ensuring direct consumer engagement consumer engagement at the point of sale and therefore we're seeing it as a strategy or a competency that costs across any type of business so that gives us the opportunity to engage with people in oil and gas fmcg retail hospitality you name it tech all over really so when we started one of the first things we did the way we launched the africa retail academy was with three certificate courses a bit similar to what timmy was speaking about earlier so we we did some segmentation work and we we we came up with three categories people are executive level people are managerial level and the people are the more basic level but not the shop floor people as timmy had mentioned because you're right that's they don't we don't need to play at that level those things can be learned and we've um worked with over we graduated last year told me i think there are about 155 uh people who came on that self-paced online course too and it's still available we're trying to revamp it uh now but that is something that is available apart from that we have done the rest we've done is bespoke customized things that fit people's needs from the programmatic perspective now so now to this proposal this idea um so it looks quite interesting what we have to now see and you tell me so that we can see how to progress it is uh because we also are interested for you to know on beyond the certificate courses we have we're interested now in doing some bite-sized um programs that are also self-paced that allow people to build credentials and then that can be another pathway to certification so for example what we did for the commerce forum you attended hopefully will end up becoming a short online course just by taking snapshots of the different things that were done so this fashion one could be another one in that series but um to be able to do that there are a couple of things i will just throw the questions out and then you can answer after that so one we need to make sure that the fashion retail program if that's what it's called i want to do it's not a repetition of what the certificate courses we already have are doing so that's the first thing secondly we need to um so i'm very interested in knowing what is the size of the addressable market we're looking at for this kind of program uh i don't want it to be maybe not just i but also as an academy we don't want it to be so so niche so so narrow that only 10 or 15 or 20 people maybe so how do we while talking because lots of people are in fashion retail but then how do we make it have that appeal so what would the size of the market be you did mention lacoste hilfiger and some other guys uh these are top tier would they find that because they are multinational and big maybe they already have things they do outside so will they find that really appealing it's something we need to validate again i want whatever we are doing to be evidence-based so i'm happy when faintola was saying that some interviewing is going on i would like to see some of those insights to know to be sure that the market really wants this and it's not it's not just us of course we are market players so that's already some level of validation but beyond us how how do we because we want something that will be sustainable something that can stand the test of time so the size of the addressable market the validation of the of the need for it because we need to come at it from a problem solving mindset so what are the pain points that people in this sector are facing that we can address through this program i was very interested also i'm curious when you said in your portfolio you are doing mobile first you mentioned them like mobile first and modular that's very interesting and it'll be good to see how we co-create this with that mindset because i think that will also help to to make it scalable and then faintola what you mentioned about iteration speed and iteration is very interesting so let us see how that could be brought to bear in in what we're doing so another question to come into my head is why fashion right why why why why should fashion retail matter how do we build a case for fashion retail is also important of course i know just look around you and and how it is the young demographic but maybe you you have something more nuanced on on why it is like that so these are the first immediate ones there are follow-up questions around the timing we're looking at the resources required what type of engagement you want to have because i can see you put the mou and so on and so forth so but just these are my first immediate questions so me and go may have other ones but these are my questions all right thank you professor um do you want to start with some and then i can go by the rest i know there were some technical ones yes i believe please correct me if i'm wrong there was a question about being mobile first there was a question about iteration speed yes and then there was there was one more i believe uh so it was the insights so how are we sharing the insights okay or what kind of insights are we getting from obviously the interviews are conducted and then how can we share that yes um how can okay so one of the i guess so first come back to the point of what i was saying like the the advantage that is coming from the collaboration between timmy and myself is that my background is more of a startup based tech based we build things quickly we learn from failing fast and failing forward and then timmy is coming with a lot of the more specific and nuanced understanding of both this market culturally and in the market which is retail um the reason why i say this is because behind the engine of what you guys see is the back end that we are also manufacturing to allow us to both do most of these things whether it is to structure our interview whether it's to improve our interview questions whether it's to think about how we want to approach something in a mobile first way and how we can do small tests in order to validate those things so for example we have a bunch of raw document files and then i've done some summarizations that have allowed me to do certain key takeaways so i'll just quickly go through some of the notes that we have on the key takeaways here and then i'll move to um the other questions if we don't have any follow-up points so i won't speak on who the person was just in case but i'll say what the takeaway was so for example we had um one person we interviewed who is a lead in quite a large like very well-known international player and one of the things that they were quite strong on was this idea of why it is that we need to have certain characteristics when it comes to hiring right so and this was something that we found in let me just look at the numbers we had one two three people that were all very very like they said it's good that people can have product knowledge but actually and this was something that changed our perspective they would rather for sales staff people be able to do routine things as opposed to you know selling via personality what they found was that when you are trying to scale these organizations so for context let's say on average i think across the three companies maybe they have two 100 to 200 staff across five plus locations and they were saying that yes it's great that you can have one star right you can have one person who is really really good and they do all of the sales but when everyone starts to sell in that manner it's just not scalable and they said that as opposed to the more theoretical things that could happen in conjunction with the thing that would actually allow them to say yes this is like quantifiable roi that we can say they did this training and this was the result it was a lot more about getting people to follow a process like due diligence and process was essentially the shell that could hold all of the other softer skills that were needed another thing as well that was quite interesting that was set across most of the larger people because we had two groups we were either interviewing a manager or as in a retail manager or we were interviewing either the owner or HR and when it came to the owner and HR what was the essentially most of them admitted that it takes them a significant amount of time in hiring to the extent that they would be very interested even outside of the training to kind of have someone who was pre-trained in this way so they one person told us that it would take them maybe 12 months to comfortably hire a manager and so anything that's going to reduce that they were very very interested in another thing that was quite common was that a lot of people found that price conversations were difficult obviously it was because of the economy but when we dug deeper into this price it wasn't just because of price what it was was that staff didn't feel that they or managers didn't feel that the staff could approach potential customers as equals so to put that into context let's say you're going to buy running shoes you either want the person who talks to you to talk to you like a comrade as opposed to yes sir no sir because it's casual hello i do not know what just happened recording in progress hi everyone sorry i don't know what happened there can you hear me yeah um so where did i cut out was i talking about the the like being comrades with or communicating as comrades to the customer or had it cut out already yeah cut out yeah you what i had last was about pricing and you're trying to so it wasn't just about right yes yeah so so what they what when we dug a bit deeper what was found was that staff are not able to approach the customers in a way that the customers felt confident that this person could help them with the sale and that was generally down to either i didn't feel like this person was knowledgeable enough about the product or they weren't talking to me in a way that i felt that we were we speak the same language so i i'm looking to buy running shoes either the person looks like they run or the way in which they are talking to me gives me the confidence that this person can tell the difference between these three running shoes for my personal reasons as opposed to just with these are the shoes we have and listing the features you're kind of asking the person so tell me how often do you run what was the last pair of running shoes that you had oh i used to have those running shoes but i found that this oh you found that as well okay they weren't able to do that and so to to give you a summary it's more that we needed to have something that is both holding someone to a process and also allowing the people to have some kind of prompts to do things so have you followed up with all of the customers that came into the shop yesterday if that's the type of model that they're doing and so on and so forth anyway we have a larger document but i just wanted to talk about those few things before i move on to the next point do we have any questions about the insights um i'll just say they are they are interesting as you spoke i went back to the modules that were sent and i can see that um we may need to refine a bit yes yeah yes yes because they are different yes but that's not a problem that's not a problem because i will come to if we are going to move ahead with this i'll come to how we can ground the the evidence coming out a bit more apart from the survey so we may need to do some kind of focus group where we invite key a representative sample of key stakeholders okay and then we ask them the key questions and go a bit deeper into these but i mean what's what you mentioned here about hiring people management pricing customer engagement sales person confidence in selling these are very critical issues and i'm sure there are more yeah yes okay and i guess one one other thing across the board when we ask people about delivery methods almost everyone said a hybrid model and outside of being hybrid they all said 10 well they always basically said under 30 minutes and mobile first training that is self-paced however it's the self-paced has a caveat this is something that we discovered during the interviews it's self-paced but there are still checkpoints along the timeline so it's not self-paced where in six months time there'll be a big exam and then if you actually fell behind in month one you went under the radar until such date instead it was yeah you know that there would be some kind of checkpoint either in a month or two months where you know that there is going to be an assessment and i'm sure we all know here when when you know there's a test coming up you you focus a bit more you take in the information with a bit more seriousness and because of course a big thing here is to let not just the salespeople improve but to also make the managers feel more confident in their abilities to lead and to help people with progression because another thing that was found that there are some managers that are managers as a result of convenience you were this person before some there's a high churn rate in your industry and you are the next best candidate so they put you there if that happens too many times just spread too thin and that's where we get these lack of soft skills we get people who have just recently joined but now they're already a manager because someone else left and this also made us um this also started a discussion about two types of training so your initial training and then refresher training because of course we don't know if everyone is going to be in a position where you know you don't want some of your intake has just done an exam and another part of the intake haven't done an exam in six months to me tell me if there's any insights that you think just i'm trying to obviously we have so many so i'm trying to like take from the different areas dude is that is that okay can we move on to like iteration and and the other things or are there any questions so you said 30 minutes they don't want the yeah it was generally 10 minutes it was just that there was one there was one person who believed that a lot of the time because of this lack of confidence in going up to customers a lot of sales people are actually just on the shop floor on their phones so they said more they said 10 minutes is nothing they could do more but on average it was 10 minutes 10 minutes for what for training so 10 minutes daily on self-training process okay so 10 minutes daily yes to do yes you mean that the the module each session in module should be for 10-15 minutes is that what you like a lecture or section of a module yes okay very interesting okay all right okay good good good good yeah i mean just so i mean i know there's also some questions that you know i i should probably touch on as well in terms of the market and um you know why fashion retail and the rest so when we you know when we started looking at obviously the addressable market we also had this concern but it was kind of reinforced as it went ahead when you know the retail retailers that were speaking which are talking about just the issues that they're having with the pipeline and they find that because obviously because the the there's no people don't really take it as a career and they're not even aware of the roles to be honest the existing head offices for example or back-ending retail people don't even really aspire to be in those positions and so there's an issue that the industry is currently facing where there's a lot of coaching of talent you know from one place to another there you know someone from off and tumble they offer them a hundred thousand more it goes to the movie guy a thousand more it goes to lacoste and so it's it's not ultimately building up for the industry because the players in the market now i mean the the the skill set in the market now is so shallow that people are just using the players as a way of quick career progression not necessarily developing the skills to even own those roles that they're going into and one of the things that then you know they had kind of sold to us and we've also now had to build into our own thinking is how do we find a way to create a pipeline because that's where ultimately more value would lie beyond the players in the industry today and we can look around and say yes in terms of the fashion retail business there's at least 50 players and we can look at a structure that have a minimum of 30 and you know we can sell this to but then obviously there's a bit there's a lot larger more informal or less even semi-structured space where it's like an owner that owns a boutique in lecky or whatever and has not really got a fully rolled out structure but still would benefit from someone understanding how to run a fashion business being there and for us the interest was then if we can build a program that takes people from sort of the rudimentary aspects of these head officials let's call it from buying to being a mid-level buyer to an advanced buyer just as an example we can then sell this or even use this to attract talent from literally just out of university and we can use that to build the pipeline because then with the endorsement we have on one side from the actual players in the industry if we're offering a course that we say look lbs is fine but also tamil figure nike ashram tree all these players are players that that work with us and we can eventually even in a way recommend you to go and work on go and work with these people even further I told in other markets as well as we kind of scale then it becomes a big appeal there and when we're looking at those numbers we were easily saying you know in terms of the um the head office roles that we know exist in nigeria today from at least 50 players about 2 000 head office roles in totality but then we know that there's a lot more because one of the interviews we had i think was a the head of nike um and he was mentioning that this trip this program for example will be very even things in other markets like kenya which are a bit more mature there will be a lot of demand there because it's a bit more structured so for us we started having to think about how do we build a pipeline how do we start trying to pay people in and make it more attractive but we know that there's that appeal there's those existing players and they're suffering a lot from the shallow pool people just moving left and right and going up the ladder but there are no new entrants coming in people don't really know about retail as a career and then they're having this issue so we know that you know it's a scalable it's something that you know again in the interviews people are coming to say you know can we recommend talent can we help them train talent because there's no there's no um existing talent and the turnover rate is so high so by working with you know hr managers and even owners on these interviews and these conversations we've had we've really started to vet the demand and know like the core required roles you know like you said bro some of those um courses that we shared earlier you know we had even shared those prior to getting as as deep as we've gotten now with the insight so it was back to the initial point about the iteration and those were just the when we started what we knew or we assumed these are the things that the industry would need but as we go deeper we're seeing in the specific things that we can easily find a way to deliver online and you know really start pushing out to one new entrance into the into the industry but two to the existing players and i think i'm just sticking to my nose i think prof the other question you asked was why fashion um really it was just because when we're looking at the data i mean i try not to lean too much on all this euro monitor data and all of that because it tells you five billion dollar industry but you know being on the ground there we know a lot of it is informal and all of the rest but we still know that it's one of the fastest growing um because the consumer segments and by talking to some brands actually wants to come into nigeria over the next 12 months their concern has been consistently a few things around the policy and the trading environment of course or one of those has also been the talent school because they feel like the growth will be stunted because they don't have the right people they do they're not sure that people here are even able to think at an international standard so guys we're written at an international standard so for us this is an industry that we see continue to grow of course there's a large informal side but if we can make the formal side more appealing more structured more regulated we can even attract more investment more interest internationally into the markets in the long run as we then build up the pipeline for the existing players but like he said and this is my final point you know in your opening notes he said but the retail academy is not a nigeria only play the the main goal is actually africa and that is what we are also trying to do as well which what we are trying to do is build something that is easily scalable you know using mobile first using short videos you can easily just get a proof of concept going almost by the time we say we've worked with this retail and this retail and nike and this and that in nigeria we can then just take that to people in kenya people in ghana and say look this is how we've upskilled buyers in nigeria this is how we've upskilled uh visual merchandising in nigeria i'm going to do the same using this course and look at the academic body that has also endorsed this because i think especially in international context that's when the certification from lbs would or any academic body will have more even more waiting it's great in nigeria but because the players here have been a part of us building it they already know what we want to deliver but when you go internationally they might be thinking nigeria why would i use standards from nigeria to train my people here who even said nigeria is the benchmark to use but when you have an international body like an academic but that is almost like it's standardizing it then it helps a lot and that's ultimately where we're even positioning so i don't know if you've answered your question yeah thank you thank you so much so tommy do you have any question before i come back with a few more thank you prof um so absolutely i do have some questions and that's typically on the market size i did a bit of calculation and i'm approximately about 2500 capacity and that's too small markets to play in that's my concern um how can we then make the pie larger what other opportunities or what other markets could we bring into this pie because playing within 2500 would not even get us to probably even break evil or something so that's that's my own concern thank you so you said 2500 players yes that bank in time market yeah so maybe i can chime in there to me i think it's about broadening the i was alluding to that so imagine that we set up this could be the first we need to be able to if we agree let's see this as a pilot of what could be so let's say we pilot with the program and we broaden it to be for example for people interested people in retail business or people interested it's in fashion retail yeah people operating the people who have an interest in it yes and we have an africa focused view in running the program not just thinking nigeria right so we're thinking we're going to be it's going to be based on players in nigeria but thinking of an african audience will also let them speak to those those nuances then it's going to be a lot more than 2500 because so evral and it's a gradual form of our sector which is where a lot of fashion retail also happens yes it is way more than that so it's about making sure we're not too narrow in the way the program is so we need to be able to start from what is the pain points look at the broader implications of that and frame it in a language that a lot more people like democratizing access to learning around how to set up how to run and how to scale your fashion retail business for example a kind of how to um program of course adding all the different issues about people about pricing about consumer engagement and so on but that's what seems to be coming to me right okay no i think that's that's that's very it's also the way we also are approaching it as well you know at the start i mentioned that first that thing will be fashion retail again for the fact that we understand the market and playing it and also it will already stretch us because some of the players are they're not all centralized in nigeria you know further afield and it also makes us test the the versatility of the model to see if people even in hotel court or even in a crowd would still digest it and it works in the way we want but for us ultimately is very similar to you know what you're trying to do in terms of broadening and standardizing retail so fashion repo is one aspect but ultimately like i said i started with hospitality in terms of players society file strips and fashion retail in terms of former players even in nigeria think of all the restaurants hotel there's so much more but because we are not very familiar with that and she wants that what we know so again like you said it's a pilot can we pilot it can we see how this works can we get proof of concept then it's open we can learn easily you know yeah definitely but we have a hospitality initiative so if if this gets piloted and it goes well we can partner with them to develop one for so now you're talking about pilots and proof of concept you where's the money sorry to be how to get real where's the money where do you have money to do this what's what's your idea about funding this i know the the proposal and when we see the mou we see the details i know the proposal is revenue share yeah but on the cost side how are we going to fund it because we also have some budgetary considerations on our end okay so and you know timmy when we met at the e-commerce forum i was also asking you about how we could make cheaper to do we talked about using ai and some other things anyway so what is the funding model for this project internet do you want to sure this is very much yeah no no problem so in terms in terms of the funding or rather the product development the way that i'm approaching this is again very iterative and startup as opposed to enterprise um thinking so for example um because we're doing a pilot and because we're trying to build a product in collaboration with the people that we're interviewing we're looking at building things that are leveraging tools that people already use right so we know our market we know that instagram we know that mobile first we know about the attention spans the reason why i'm saying this is because there are tools and there are methods that allow us to get our training into people's hands for a very cheap amount of money considering what it is we're doing because it's content whether that is a pdf that i'm spinning up and i'm putting i'm posting it on a site and i just password protect it right that's a lot cheaper than having to do a lms straight out the gate because i don't know if we're going to do an lms in the standard sense one of the things that we had a lot of conversations about was how we were going to go about testing people about real life scenarios how are we going to do scenario testing am i going to make a chatbot that will sit on something like telegram and it will say scenario one a customer has come to you and they're not happy about the price of something um given the quality of the garment how would you start speaking to the person are we going to then do voice training and it's going to listen to what the person has to say are we going to have one of the things we spoke about was how we're going to have experts to review people's videos that they submit i can leverage ai for part of it are we going to have someone else for part of it so we know it's it's less i don't think we're going to build anything in our pilot that's going to be over like a million now that's the whole point of how we're playing specifically for a very very small pilot so it's it's not we're not worried about the cost because we know that we're actually working in a very scrappy way and we're using the best um tools i can stand here and stay testament that as the world is changing technologically i'm witnessing firsthand a price collapse before if you wanted to have some graphics made it would cost you anywhere between let's say anywhere between 10 to 50 us dollars for one graphic and it might take you a day it might take you a week and back and forth iteration outside of this project i've spun things up with timmy in like minutes so we're we're not we're not really in an issue of our product development what we're actually thinking about and this is where i guess again as i have an understanding of our user is what is the best way for a user to do something right to be are people really going to get the most out of 10 minutes if they have to type their responses are they going to get the most and it's going to be the most natural if we ask them to put their phone against the wall and record and practice a scenario how are we going to make sure that people understand the scenarios properly okay we know that people can see visuals faster than they can read so we're going so are we going to have these small you know 30 second scenes customer sell stuff customer sell stuff and then it pauses and it says what would you do if he was in this situation and then they say do they record a voice note these are the things that like we are now able to do in today's day and age with technology and it's just about what is the best way to do that for the least amount of effort to validate the concept and that's why i believe that regardless of what we're doing we're able to pivot so efficiently that and we we get to take our learnings with us in each time as we're having this conversation with you i think we've already um had and let go of maybe two ideas and this is the kind of thinking that like is what allows those startups that you see later down the line to do so well it's less about the product that they have today and more about the team speed of iteration and their understanding being user focused i hope okay i hope i've answered the uh the question you have excited me even though you we still need to know how much but but it's fine i mean i like i like the thinking i also like the approach to program design which is very user focused and is going to make the program a lot more accessible i i was thinking about the lms approach but and that was why i was because building an lms can be quite something but you are coming up with something else which is easier but also a lot more modern and maybe would even work better i like the idea for example of you know asking them this plays up to this point that you ask them how would you how would you approach it that that really makes it more interactive and engaging and i also one thing you mentioned during the insights aspect of your talk was how people wanted a hybrid self-paced thing so guided self-paced interaction and that definitely is what we want to do that is when we started our self-paced course here we didn't um we didn't have that in mind but immediately we saw that a lot of people wanted hand-holding throughout their their program and it's good that that has come up again so yes that's that's that makes sense um so what i would what i would say okay one other thing before i say what we should what our purpose we do so jimmy you are the one i know more why she helped us partner with timmy and faye on this let me be very like open i mean i know you guys are great guys yeah you've done a lot but what is the what has uh forged done you know what is the because again i don't want to sound condescending not at all i'm learning a lot from you guys but also because we are internationally accredited by several institutions to take to have this mou approved at the board level and i sit on the board my colleagues are going to ask that question so who are these forge guys what have they done why should we what what is the risk that lbs may be taken with partnering with forge that will need to be litigated and stuff like that so that would need to uh also be addressed thank you sir thank you yes so very clear so i think before we should talk about the individuals because we're the ones sport is just an entity it's usually like i said it's a layer of it or like so i mean on my own side you know like you mentioned prof you know we've engaged a few times just in summary so i've been in fashion retail at this point 14 years of my career i have a master's from local edu fashion fashion retail management i have i initially started my career on the shop floor in the uk many years ago and then i worked many head office roles um for some brands well-known luxury brands like paul smith and tom ford michael kors and the rest primarily my experience at that time was wholesale so i was selling these brands to retailers in different regions across the world primarily initially around across europe but then i started looking at the emea region and then in 2016 i got an opportunity to work with at that time tm lewin because they had a franchise partner in nigeria called smart mac and as we know and um so smart mac had just invested quite a lot in their business but they needed somebody that could help the brand scale quickly because tm lewin was already in existence in nigeria for many years but was very informal uh you know bankers were wearing the shirts but people were bringing them in there's a lot of fakes and all of all kinds of issues in the market so i moved back to nigeria in 2016 to build that business the tm lewin business um you know we opened up stores all across nigeria and that's when we even entered ghana as well so we opened up in buttercut in enugu in ibadan abuja and all the rest all the major malls had the presence by the second year of my time there which was 2018 i then built this business and we would be i become the most profitable business in the group that i now started leading now my contract now is from only tm lewin which was what brought me here to then brought me up to other fashion franchises in the region so i started taking over the swatch i took over the swatch business levi's business and still managed the tm lewin business so at that point my roots in the industry started getting a lot stronger i did that for another year and a half in fact covid up to covid then covid struck and all the malls were closed down everything was on standstill but then what then happened after covid then you know when everything kind of reopened was people started dressing down you know people were not really wearing tires as much suits as much so a lot of the brands i mean levi's was doing well for me yes but this tm lewin business that had become almost a cash cow for all of us and was the primary reason that it wasn't all of a sudden like wasn't going to make it and internationally at that time the brand actually went into administration so it was at this point that i needed to pivot and then i started working a lot bringing brands into the country so we started looking at you know started conducting a lot of visibility and this is a game where my reputation i helped because at that point i was fairly familiar with the whole sales space in the uk i knew a few partners here so we're able to pivot to a brand called charles turrets which is similar to tm lewin but a bit more business casual so they have polo shirts chinos and the rest which helped a lot so we got in that brand up but that one was based on relationship you know i knew the people and i was able to sell them my reputation and all of that after that did that for another one year or two and then putting even more brands because after you kind of get a good reputation of bringing one or two brands and it works in the country it's easy for you to attract brands and in the course of two three years after that i brought in clarks dune um i'll go into into the country and set them up in the malls and it just became like plug and play because again your reputation just keeps helping you um after in 2022 there was some xenophobic attacks and all of those issues and there was issues with the malls again so i decided i then got an offer to join jimmy's management team um because they wanted to build out their fashion category so it is but for me this was the first time i was in e-commerce i'd never really done if i was in the malls on the ground so i did i joined jimmy's e-commerce team and i managed their commercial business for two years so initially in the first six months i joined to onboard nike adidas all these brands on jimmy because jimmy was having the issue of too many fakes people don't trust jimmy buying fashion on jimmy so we worked to get brands on jimmy but quickly that then became me managing even for the first time in my life other categories that were not fashion so tvs appliances all of those but i did that for two years and then i you know moved back into fashion retail when i had an opportunity to partner with ash luxury to bring in luxury brands into the market but this one was a different model because this unlike others i've done in the past where you it's a very expensive way of expanding because franchise you get the store import the fittings you do all these things this one is an existing store is a multi-brand environment so they already have the space they just want different stores on different brands on different rails and this was honestly again just because the reputation was very easy relatively to achieve over two and a half years we brought in 50 brands because again a smaller way of entry doesn't need an initial order pitch to them again the reputation and relationships helped a lot so this is what i've done you know my whole career i've really interacted with a lot of international brands especially when you do franchise when you see the owners the pressure they put on you to deliver here not in revenue only but in the standards uniformity of standards they want the experience in south africa to be like london london to be like lagos but it's always difficult telling me you start looking at a bad or secondary cities it's very very difficult so i always knew in my head that when i had the opportunity to figure out a way we could support these partners standardize it you know this is what i would want us to do in the market so you know this year was the year super dollar has always been in the tech space like you mentioned he has worked a lot in consulting was supporting um a lot of businesses scale in the uk primarily but in the last two years here then very similar trajectory boy was supporting meccano grow their own businesses here because with meccano they have different lines you know they have ghillie cars and the generators and also he needed to do a lot of the infrastructure to help them monitor all the activities so he just then became almost like a an alignment of sorts when it was like well this is an issue i know very well i know that there's gaps here but if you can help me translate some of your tech background into this there's an opportunity here and this is why you know we are where we are today with just so forth in unc right now all does is consulting so we do consult for existing players but nothing we've not yet you know this this this platform is the main new thing we're doing okay so this is going to be your flagship yeah flagship product definitely okay okay very well explained excellent okay so um the next steps i would like to propose uh and you will see whether you want them so a draft mou draft where it will come from you to us with the different things you you want in there so we can study study it as an institution and then make our own comments and then sign it um secondly while that is happening because i mean that's parallel can we see you you did send a proposal earlier now can we see something like a a roadmap with timelines that we can study together for the pilots that want to do pilot program okay um so inside that roadmap there will be some steps stage one we need to do this stage two we need to do this i know that in the proposal you had sent earlier there was a bit of that but maybe with a bit more to update it more or less to update it so that we can see realistically how long we want to spend on this who we need to talk to to do further validation of what should feature how to select faculty to be on it um then the design side so fake faint color excited me with some of the things he said about the tech side and how it will look how the user will be engaged so i want to see that um a bit more developed in the proposal to see okay if we're going to have five modules or four modules or 10 modules like a script what would that look like is it a short five minute video here from an expert then this then some question probe questions some assessment just i want to see my head um a bit descript of how it will look like and then the last bit is how much what's what's a tentative what are we going to spend on doing this uh before we then look at pricing what's what do we charge the people to make it as accessible as possible again i don't know the tech side of where you want to host it but you talked about instagram you talked about some other place so what's where where will it be hosted uh to to make sure that it's a lot of people reach it but also that people don't go there and steal and then eventually you know piracy or whatever becomes an issue is that okay does that work yes so okay so for us in terms of timing we're already in june so tommy well let's look at this because um for you to know we're also trying to revamp the existing one we have on an lms um so we have to be realistic about the timing how long do we when do we want to launch the final uh product and so that we're working with the time that is suitable for both parties just just for me to clarify that i'm on the same page when we are talking about the final product we're not talking about the final sales stuff product we're talking about the final product ie the visual merchandising the commercial buyer that's what we're referring the back the back of office or head office um tiers or track is that i didn't get that please say that again i didn't get what you said no so i just want to make sure that when you are talking about this mou and this roadmap and the things that is for it's not about the sales training which was the things for the on-floor stuff it's for the more managerial like or the head office role yes yes yes i guess one one follow-up question that i have is just outside of this discussion when is your faculty looking to have the program revamped for because that will probably help us to gauge what is helpful for you and what isn't helpful for you so tommy you should be able to answer our question because that project is under you absolutely so we look forward to the revamp um ending at the fourth quarter that's fourth quarter of this year this year as end as in december but again that you don't deter because if we have a roadmap and we know this month we should have done this but this month things can happen concurrently so it doesn't mean we must finish this before we start looking ideating on this but it's just for you to know to have that in your mind also okay no problem thank you yeah okay so um timmy why don't we see your mou yes sir drafts and the roadmap then we study it together we look at it then look at it as a school and legal people and um since you people are fast and i was going to say fast and furious but i decided not to add the furious part of fast and iterative if you are ready to go with speech we will um we'll go with you but what i like a couple of very nice i hope this is not just to make the proposal sound sweet there are some things you wrote here that are quite exciting so for example when i saw how you want to use ai on this embed ai scenario branching chatbots for clientele practice demanding games is that part of what we want to put on this so these these are all ideas for how we can go about training people so that the idea is more this comes from design thinking so this is where like i didn't really get to speak about my background but i guess i'll just quickly add so i um studied chemical engineering then i pivoted into tech and the first role that i had in tech was at an agency where we focused on what is called cro cro is conversion rate optimization so you are a business and you have some kind of digital entity whether that's a web shop whether it's that you sell education you sell some kind of travel package you have something that you want customers to buy and our company's sole purpose was to help you convert more for whatever metric you are most interested in being your primary metric from there i went to another organization that was now focused in tech so it was health tech this was during covid so we were trying to make it so that end to end you are able to focus on your your ill you speak to a doctor you get your prescription you go to the pharmacy you show your prescription you get your medication you didn't have to go to the pharmacy and obviously i'm sure you can imagine in this height we were dealing with a lot of people and this ties in with something that was said earlier as well around the total addressable market because if we go on linkedin and we search retail manager then we say location nigeria oh yeah go ahead okay cool and we say location nigeria i saw 72 pages if we say 50 of those people and if i marry that up with a statistic that we found in our interviews which is on average it's looking like 4,5 sales staff per manager so that's another way i'm just giving for the total addressable market because i know that there was one method that was being used but this is another way to see that's much larger just for nigeria um to bring it back to your question on these nice things so the game i think will take more development so based on what we have found now in the price points that we're looking at where people can because it has to work in a way is what percentage of someone's salary are people willing to pay for a training i think game development might be too slightly far out of that bracket for the cell staff but things like the scenario testing and things like where we're trying to see how we can off-board the marking or how they can hire or in order to because for example if you have four people if you're a manager you have four cell staff and they do an exam twice they do an exam once a month and each of their exams is 10 minutes and they submit 10 minutes worth of video 40 minutes worth of video let's say twice with 80 minutes per month do the managers have that time can we use ai in order to have a schema to mark people and then to kind of empower the managers these are all the kind of thing the reason why i'm again talking very broadly is to show you that we are pivoting around the problem the problem in this case is how do we engage people and make sure that the marking is of a standard and one of the methods is the video analysis one of the methods is a scenario testing one of the methods is a form so yes you will see them whether they will they probably won't all be in the final version because we are doing this kind of you know goalie log zone oh this one is too hard oh this one is too soft this one is too right okay i'll go with that sorry okay no that's fine that's fine just one i didn't want to interrupt but i actually need to run now i have another call that i started at 11 no problem we have we all need to run too yeah all right thank you guys so we'll be looking forward to hearing from you on the next step sir okay all the best thank you thank you all right thank you goodbye
