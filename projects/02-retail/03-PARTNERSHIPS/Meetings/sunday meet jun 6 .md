Nicholas Folarin-Coker  0:01  
Okay, fantastic.

Timilehin Tikolo  0:06  
Much, bro, not much you got my good time. Actually, I did you just like, sat down on my laptop to try and go through some of this work. Perfect. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  0:21  
cool. So I'm trying to remember what your last voice note said, so you can just go.

Timilehin Tikolo  0:33  
I can't really remember, but what I need to do is, I know you send me the new questions. The new question, yeah, I want to, I'm looking at those right now. The new owner, HR, manager, or you have them. No, no, no, you send them already on the group. So I've opened, I've opened the right here. Okay, cool, um, because obviously, you know the interview we've got this afternoon at 12. Yeah, is, yeah, it's owner manager, owner HR manager questions we're using. So I'm just trying to go through the questions, just to be sure. You know, the the solid, there's, like, a lot more questions now, the 33 questions. So we can, we can cut it. We can cut it down.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:24  
It's just that now we have a variety to pick from how the conversation but like, it's more nuanced now because you you have no basic one. So like, let's say, for example, you could skip five because you already know what the answers would be for that person. And you what you actually want to know is, do you know I'm so but we can go through them now, if you want, you want to do that. Yeah, happy to do that, bro, I didn't. I don't mind. So we can go, Okay, let me, let's do it like this. Let let us think about what things we could do, and then let's pick the one that's because usually we don't have both of us on a call. And sometimes, you know, I mean, let's, let's just call that, Okay, so first we have reviewed interview questions. Then there's also, I mean, I don't know. Did you have anything on the landing page, or you call it,

Timilehin Tikolo  2:26  
oh, I want to. I've opened it now as well, so we can go through again, um, and

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  2:39  
then, on my part, which is that, like, I wanted to discuss, like, what, what asset would be useful, for example, a mock up of, like a membership area, a scenario tool. Or like I could even, I was thinking about this yesterday, I could make like a scenario, and it could just be a series of the, you know, that new Google Video model, yeah. Voice, so, like, do you know, I mean, we could actually have, like, here's a, here are scenarios,

Timilehin Tikolo  3:13  
like potential, like,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  3:14  
content that you would see within an exam, or within a scenario test, or within,

Timilehin Tikolo  3:19  
yeah, I think that'll be good. I think that'll be a good one, actually. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  3:24  
so discuss Rita as these, and then one of them is via video. Um, okay, cool. There was another thing as well, um, which was,

give me one second, have it in my in my project management. Oh, this is, this is great. So, yeah, we've done this. Done. Okay, so another thing is, like, basic, you know, I'll leave that one for now, because it depends on how let's I feel like. So we've got three here. So review interview questions, review the landing page and discuss the desire I feel like, Yeah, still review the interview page. Is that's, that's probably the interview questions. Probably the, the highest ROI one for a time right now,

Timilehin Tikolo  4:43  
also just final point align on if you've got time at the end, is what the what the plan is for the lbs Call on Thursday. Ah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  4:56  
okay, that discuss lbs, sorry, that is a very good point. I wasn't looking at it from a time perspective, because I do actually have on my otter here, all of our like, our schedule. Okay, yeah, cool, actually, actually, that's okay. So what we should actually do, I think, I think we there's what there. So there's two other things. There's discuss lbs, but there's also just going to discuss the week, because we actually have stuff, because I can see today, one June 9 to June 10, another one and June 13, I actually I messaged the co working people. So I'm gonna book Monday, Tuesday and Friday,

Timilehin Tikolo  5:46  
which actually holiday on Monday. So do you need to book it?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  5:53  
Are you going into the office? That's a good point. Okay, cool. See, this is good. So I won't book Monday, then I will book Tuesday and Friday. But also, do you think I should book another day?

Timilehin Tikolo  6:08  
So you so we, so we Tuesday, so Tuesday? Yeah, fair. You don't need Monday. And he said you're going to book whichever day Friday. Alright, you have, we've now got what? Let me check that out before. Is it Friday or Thursday? Let me check on the 13th of June, the fashion retail.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  6:29  
Wait, let me get my actual

Timilehin Tikolo  6:35  
Yeah, 13th.

Yeah, 13 at 10am yeah, so that's on on Friday. Yeah, right. It's Friday.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  6:53  
So because the whole time I'm essentially trying my hardest to, like, not have anyone pin me down, yeah, lie up around the corner happens a fine that is, like, walkable distance, that's basically, that's not really the way it's gonna work, although, if I, if I have to, like, ask, it won't, it won't happen for forgiveness anyway. So okay, you don't think I need to book another day. You think Tuesday and Friday are sufficient. Or the reason why I'm saying is, let's say there's an opportunity to book others.

Timilehin Tikolo  7:31  
I'm just thinking because I'm looking at the actually one second, let me look at the tracker that we have, yeah, see, just because, you know, like I'm travelling on on Wednesday, so I'm definitely not booking anything on Wednesday.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  7:45  
Are you travelling? Yeah, I remember going to

Timilehin Tikolo  7:47  
London for like 10 days. Remember I told you? Oh, yeah. So it's on Wednesday, so it's Wednesday. So, so next week, Sunday, so it's like 10 days. So I mean, obviously I can do interviews there. I'm just, but the first, like, this Wednesday, obviously that I'm travelling, I'm not booking anything. And, yeah, okay, so, yeah, I feel like we should be okay for, like, at least this week. I feel like if more interviews wanted to do, I'll probably try and push them to the weekend. Yeah, like one day. Because if you what's the name of this tracker? Sorry, on a VOD interview schedule, I'm just trying to go through so we've got Ijeoma today. Ijama is what do you call it, um, Adidas, then we've got smart mark. So she so I will still do Abu, but, like, she's like, the head of commercial, okay, so we're doing him tomorrow.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  9:02  
Um, I'm wondering, I'm wondering, how do you know it's fine? I'll take this transcript. Yeah, any, any like details you even have to be like, so, so coherent in terms of like as the thoughts come. But any, just, just as long as it's clear, as in the audio, anything that comes to mind about any of these people that's like information that you know, that I might find helpful. And an example might be

something that like, yes, it could be revealed later in the interview, but you know it, and it'd be useful if I know it also at the beginning of the interview. Does that make

Timilehin Tikolo  9:47  
sense? Yeah, yeah, I'm

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  9:50  
just But anyway, let's go. Okay, cool. So, okay, so shall we? Shall we do a rapid fire through the interviews, yeah, through the questions, and then we can talk about lbs, and then see how much time we have. Because worst case, you can look at the landing page whenever, and like, effectively, if we could, if we didn't have a lot of time, the only thing I would need from you is a scenario, and then I would try to, like, basically, make the scenes

Timilehin Tikolo  10:32  
okay. I feel like, also just, just to get more interviews out of the way, I might try and do my day this evening. I'll see what her even is like, okay, cool. Just because one thing I'm trying to do is, like, get as many of like the and I think with the people we have lined up, we've got, like, a lot of senior people seeing now on Tuesday that by the time we take the information out of that and whatnot, like ahead of the meeting on Friday for lbs, whatever shape or form we need that, you know, or however we feel like that partnership can still work. We at least have, like, proper industry proof of concept. You know what? I mean, it's like at this point going to head of Nike, head of Adidas, head of this, head of that. Like, yeah, yeah, okay, so should we get through the questions?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  11:28  
Okay, okay, let's do the questions first, and then we'll and then we'll look at the what do you call them? The meetings this week? Oh, shit. Wait, give me one second. I

I just, I've been delaying. I haven't messaged my dead back. So now, like, if I don't do it now, it'll be too close. I can come for 2pm really don't want to do this. I'm gonna say free. PM,

Timilehin Tikolo  12:07  
where you going to the house?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  12:21  
Yeah, I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just, I'm gonna just, hello man. I'm gonna just deal with it. I'm gonna just, I don't want to think it's a, it's a real like, anyway, let's get to this actual thing. So you're, you're talking about the craft link, that's what you're looking at, right? You

Timilehin Tikolo  12:42  
you're looking at, right? The tune, yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  12:48  
you're looking at the craft link, right? Yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  12:52  
yeah, the craft Yeah. But the owner, HR, manager, okay, cool. So the HR interview, yeah, that one you're on.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  13:08  
Yeah, I can, okay, cool, you can see me. So

Timilehin Tikolo  13:14  
the most common skill gaps you observe in your front that one is good, still, definitely.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  13:21  
So you're looking at Question one, yeah, okay,

Timilehin Tikolo  13:28  
sorry. Question two, what key behaviours or competencies do you want to see consistently that's still fine to stay that's the question too. Now this one is new certification system. Appetite, would you invest in a professional certification system that standardises retail skills? Yeah, this is good, but I feel like this section should probably come, like, later. Okay, can you, like, drag it, yeah, like, she come like two.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  14:12  
Oh, you we can move it now, yeah, okay, should we, should I just write later now?

Timilehin Tikolo  14:18  
Yeah, yeah, please, yeah, just write later. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  14:26  
as I'm like editing it, can you see these edits?

Timilehin Tikolo  14:28  
Yeah, I can see you writing later. Okay, cool, sweet. Question four, how valuable would it be to hire staff and recognise retail certification from other companies. How valuable would it be to have retail staff turns off a recognised retail certification? I think we can just remove from other companies, just like the questions should stop. Yeah, we recognise retail certification. Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. Then describe your last hiring process. We kindly had potential retail certification last time experience. What question did

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  15:20  
you we need? That bit, and then describe your last hiring process. Yeah, if you don't think we can remove it like it's better, it's better to remove something and to optimise something we don't need. So if your gut React is not then, so cool.

Timilehin Tikolo  15:42  
Would you the next question? Question five, would you support system with staff and transferable qualifications that have the correct progression?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  15:51  
I don't like this question, yeah, because I feel like, socially, you're bound to say yes, yeah, exactly.

Timilehin Tikolo  15:58  
Like, maybe

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  15:59  
if it was reworded, but like, yeah, I feel like people are all going to I don't feel it all gonna get real answers.

Timilehin Tikolo  16:06  
It's not gonna give us anything new. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Manager capability assessment, how confident are you are your store managers in evaluating stuff performance objectively? Yeah, this one is good, because then if they say they're not really confident in the manager,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  16:33  
you months down the line, this is the thing you're saying in the car. It's like, are they available? You said something. You're like the managers of convenience,

Timilehin Tikolo  16:41  
yeah, yeah, exactly. This is how we objectively

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  16:45  
rate the maturity of the managers, yeah, in the eyes of the owner and HR,

Timilehin Tikolo  16:56  
I don't know if we can maybe in this one, then ask almost like a follow up question about, like, how am I gonna put this? Like, if it's like a, sorry, I'm trying to articulate this if it's a location thing, if, if you, if you feel more confident and managers that are like, closer to sort of like managers in Lagos, for example, if you feel more confident in the ability versus managers in, I don't know, outside Lagos, like out station locations, like in Enugu, for example, and that could just be because they are further away, so you feel like they are not as engaged as a teammate, or They don't see enough good examples, as the people here. Do you know what I mean? But again, I'm just trying to think, what's the real value of that? Because if they say yes, we trust our Lagos managers more, then it's just what? Then it gives us more ammunition to say, if

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  17:58  
we Yeah, if I'm understanding your question, would the question actually be, do you feel there's more are you? Are you really trying to ask? Is there more revenue that you you feel isn't being realised by managers that aren't in your like, district or locale or head office, or because that's what you're trying to you're like, Okay, if you feel more confident in your managers that are close to you, in your managers that are far away from you, that would imply that they could be doing more. IE, the business could be doing better. IE, you could have more revenue.

Timilehin Tikolo  18:33  
Yes, but they're

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  18:38  
not engaged. Maybe that's just how anubi people, or however they are, people are

Timilehin Tikolo  18:44  
exactly, or, like, even on this on so the point I was even trying to tie it to was not even revenue. In this case, it's just to this question six, about like, being able to evaluate people because, you know, saying in the car that day when, when we're talking about managers of convenience, that thing primarily happens as, like, primarily outside Lagos, because you, if someone leaves, you struggle to find someone quickly, easily. Do you know, I mean, I knows the business, so you likely just move the next person in the store up and then hire a junior person and try and train that one in the system. You know what I mean. But the person who moved up may not actually be a manager, yeah? But then in

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  19:37  
sir, as in there they were convenient hire? Yeah, exactly

Timilehin Tikolo  19:43  
No, because they actually, like, earned the position. Versus in Lagos, right? If someone left a store, you could, you probably have, like, two, three stores in Lagos, example, or you have other other people, do you know? I mean, you have a bigger pool, you could poach, you could do all these other things and get another manager to replace the manager that left, and you can kind of keep the level high enough, um, whereas outside Lagos is difficult, and so if you keep doing that over time, would that affect? That would naturally affect your, your trust in the managers outside? Do you know what I mean? Because it's like you are not necessarily like the best managers, but you're the manager, and that would impact how they evaluate staff performance objectively to the question, but I was just trying to see if we could get them to admit that was the case. What's the value for us out of getting that insight is the value ultimately, then, well, this is why, for outside, outside Lagos or whatever of stores that have low or for businesses that have low trust in next their store managers, we are now adding like a third level of authentication, which is also like an area manager or an HR person that also has to sign off. Do you know what I mean? Is that going to be the justification for us adding that third level awesome? She's

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  21:11  
awesome. The direct question like, um, we have this idea that we wanted to like, do you know, I mean way less like structured, hi. We have this idea that we wanted to float by you. Some of the people we've already interviewed have expressed that engagement among their managers is lower because of the lack of talent in those areas. To make sure that you have a uniform standard across your organisation, we believe that for your location outside of your head office location, you should have a third level of assessment or stakeholder involved in the process, as opposed to two, which we recommend for the head office staff. Do you think that makes sense to you in theory? And they can just answer that how they want,

Timilehin Tikolo  22:00  
yeah, 100% okay, let's do that yeah. We can add

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  22:05  
just Yeah. The transcript will

Timilehin Tikolo  22:08  
Yeah, so that can come after yeah discussions, because then it will be about after this. Question Six is about the confidence and ability. Question seven would then be, oh, wait. Okay, no, Question seven is still fine. Question seven is Yeah, yeah. So then yeah, we can add the extra level then question seven. What's your biggest concern about relying on managers for staff evaluation? Okay, no, no, no, actually, sorry, the question we're just adding to come after question seven. Okay, because seven and six follow each other quite well. Okay.

I think we can remove this. Tell us about a time when you disagree the manager's assessment. Okay,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  23:19  
manager's assessment, Question Eight. Remove it.

Timilehin Tikolo  23:26  
No, no, some question it is the box you're just on under question seven. So, yeah, yeah, okay, so question eight, now, would you prefer objective evaluation, so video subjects or managing led assessments?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  23:52  
I think I should remove first, sorry, I think remove this video submissions because, like, personally, I think the video submissions is like, the best thing, because I know, like, yes, there is a way to cheer, but it's so much harder, and it's so it requires so much effort, I don't think they have, but in either case, is basically I'm saying I want, like, video solutions to be involved. So anyway, yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  24:17  
no, we can remove that. Because remember, what we're doing anyway is a mixture of both, but they're going to do objective whatever Every month

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  24:31  
anyway, so intense local ownership combination. Oh, yeah, I tried on this question, you know, well, broken down which one question eight like the level of answer you'd get if you just have question eight without options?

Timilehin Tikolo  24:53  
Yeah.

Yeah, that's stretchy. That's impressive, yeah, but we don't, do we need it. I don't think we need that. I think,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  25:12  
I think we need it, not for our benefit, but like, because remember, as we're doing this, we're also pre framing, pre framing potential clients. Mm, although we know why and what and what, it's just good to that they're like, Oh, these guys are considering that. That's like, they're really doing their due diligence, whatever they come up with, like, I'm in, I'm interested,

Timilehin Tikolo  25:36  
fair enough. Okay, yeah, no header, if it's for free. And then, yeah, that works. Yeah.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  25:41  
I feel like this is a quick one as well. They might say something that helps with, like, the product development,

Timilehin Tikolo  25:47  
yeah, okay, okay, fair enough. Uh,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  25:51  
what topics, modules,

Timilehin Tikolo  25:53  
the most valuable thing, huge. Yeah, this is very much training, upside and questioning.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  26:03  
So, yeah, dictates the syllabus.

Timilehin Tikolo  26:09  
Okay, cool, yeah. I mean, they're probably going to say one of their parts, but yeah, sure, oh, they will. Okay. Is

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  26:17  
there anything missing? Um, um,

Timilehin Tikolo  26:23  
objection handling. I'm selling custom

customer experience. Yeah, that's yeah.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  26:36  
I want to ask a follow up question, which is, if you could only Have one? Jen, on, yeah, if you said,

right now,

hmm, okay,

cool 10 plus minus Yes. I mean they're gonna say yes to 10, aren't they, who wouldn't refer

Timilehin Tikolo  27:20  
to change so it, yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  27:26  
is if would you pay extra? That's really what we want to do. Want to customise things. Everyone, yeah, you pay a premium for the trainings? Yeah. Now is a question that we want to know the answer to, yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  27:57  
yeah, okay. The next industry

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  28:04  
standardizations. Do you believe the Nigerian retail industry needs standardisation skills?

I mean, it's a good way. It's It's okay. So this, this, this, this is something that can be used in a deck like the result of this. So he asked X number, obviously, them doing this means that it's yes. But like, do you know, I mean, for like, an lbs, and whatever, this is a data pool.

Timilehin Tikolo  28:36  
But then, okay, so I guess, yeah, I hear you. I guess it would just the question, is good, I agree with I might just need to explain a bit more than what's written out here to explain how, you know, if we have skill levels, like at, you know, rough skill benchmarks. So for example, level

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  28:57  
better English than, or, most very important, English than, like, standardised skill levels, or there's more elaboration

Timilehin Tikolo  29:03  
today, I can just elaborate a bit more on it's just like, for example, you know, managers, so that they understand. Because, again, standardisation is in different things, right? But what we're trying to standardise except the skill levels, yes. But what does that mean? Like standardisation and benchmarking, almost it's like, essentially, what we're trying to do is say, for anybody to be a manager in Nigerian retail, informal Nigerian retail sector, you have to be like a level eight, for example, and an assistant manager is a level six and supervisor. You know what I mean? Like we want, yeah, yeah, something like that, yeah.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  29:53  
I know it doesn't make sense, but like, yeah, gone, yeah. I feel like there's a reason why. When people do these kind of numbers stuff, it's not always as straightforward. I feel like if you go from one to two, you don't feel as, like, proud of yourself, even it makes me I feel like going from one to three, you're, you're going to brag

Timilehin Tikolo  30:15  
more. Yeah, you have to stretch it out as well. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  30:20  
it's very strange. But everywhere I went, I always noticed, if you weird, it's like there's a psychology to the numbers. Anyway, yeah, no,

Timilehin Tikolo  30:31  
you definitely stretch it out because. But the only thing is, this is a different question for also for this one now, right? Not for the interview question, but just a question that came to my head. This is great when people are joining the industry, right? So you can easily put them on, like, oh yeah, start and go and do, like, your from, from internal or maybe, yeah, entry level, maybe not intern, maybe, like, entry level in this reward, reward the intern on this piece, bro. So entry Yeah, entry level or something. But basically, from the question, I was trying to say is, so if someone joins the retail business as entry level, and we then enrol them on the Forge course, it makes sense we do that in the next four years. You can get to level six or nine or whatever it is, right over the next four or five years. However, what if I've been a manager already, now in a store for like, three years, and my company now has signed up to forge how would we approach it? Oh, yeah, because I'm not gonna go back and

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  31:46  
do what I like, how I would approach it. Obviously, there's a level of doing something that doesn't scale, so I think that we could just run a test, right? We're gonna you, because you already have experienced staff to calibrate our system, we'd like them to do the scenario tests. We will then be able to form a benchmark average, both within your organisation by from different submissions and then within our larger data pool from other managers, where we can say, we think that your managers, you have four managers, two, one of them is a level nine and the level six. And your strongest is obviously your level nine. Your second strongest is Mr. Yemen, your first GC, I mean, and then that we have, we essentially give it to them, and they can decide whether you can watch the videos if you want. You can see the assessment that we broke down of this person. You can see what they have adhered to from the SOPs and brand guidelines and sales guidelines that you provided us with. And you can see where they've they've changed from the mark. It's a live video like AI, is not that good that we wouldn't be able to even if they read, all right, even if they read the whole thing. I just, I just, I don't think they're gonna be if you're sick, if you're so sick at lying and doing that on the spot like you're a good manager anyway, you're a good salesperson anyway. Your improvisation skills are amazing, but I just don't think that they're that nice with it.

Timilehin Tikolo  33:28  
So, yeah, anyway, so your solutions, essentially, we force,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  33:39  
or like a what's the word? Like an assessment, like an initial assessment. So you're saying, Yeah, initial assessment. So every organisation

Timilehin Tikolo  33:50  
we we take on board, because now I'm just because this now is part of our process, essentially, if this is what we're saying. So is it like every organisation we sign up, we're gonna have to do an initial assessment of their team to know like essentially, if

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  34:08  
you say it like that, then it can't be videos, because that will take way too long. So we can do quizzes, right? Everyone signs up and they do a 50 question quiz, right? And they have to do it in 10 minutes, because the whole point is that everything is done 10 minutes once, 10 minutes daily, to do all the questions. And then they get an assessment, and based on that assessment, we will then make a recommendation, and then become that way quicker Company A their average score is below our average. That we would say is for just sales Foundation. We actually give me sales foundation one and two, and as a result of that, this is how they can go about it. Yeah, I just think there's an initial assessment.

Timilehin Tikolo  35:02  
Yeah, okay, so then do we have, again, just to be like, super whatever? Do we have, like, an initial assessment for managers and initial assessment officers associated, because I would imagine a manager's needs, yeah, I think we should just standardise

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  35:19  
it, and there's we, we lose nothing by making it the onboard part of the onboarding process that everyone who is enrolled does a standardised an initial assessment.

Timilehin Tikolo  35:34  
Yeah, what I'm saying is to be, is it one assessment, regardless of your level, if you're a manager, to assess, assessments, it will be

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  35:44  
one assessment, but like they will indicate whether they are a sales associate or a manager within the questions,

Timilehin Tikolo  35:52  
right? So the question is

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  35:55  
easier, do you know what you're right? It's easier to just have it doesn't really matter, because the days can be joined and split, very easy. But yeah, there are, oh, I see what you're saying. Sorry, no, you're right. It's two questions, two sets of questions. You can't ask the same questions of a manager that we ask over. Yeah, yeah, no, you're right, you're right, yes, two questions, two sets of questions, yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  36:23  
because, again, because this is just like, because, then what it could be is, if you already have a manager in your business, right, yeah, then we know, like, essentially, he should be on at least level six, yeah, at least by our thing. So if you're saying this is your manager, then we'll give him the assessment, and we'll say, okay, you know what? He's done it. And fair enough, he's not really like a good manager. So starting from level six, but a manager can go back to being like a level two. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  36:58  
yeah, that's and to be honest with you, that's where we can have, like, a real, a real we develop much better and deeper relationships with the owners, because, like, we have to, we don't have to be able to tell them or hate that, like, Yo, like this person is, like, they really don't know your product.

Timilehin Tikolo  37:17  
Yeah, I think, I think, I think that's that works. I think that works.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  37:24  
And within the question, I'm definitely going to add, like, a part where they have to do send a voice, though, or something, something, because obviously, like a big enough organisation, I've done it myself, like you and your guys. You sit down and do the test together. Yeah, exactly. That's

Timilehin Tikolo  37:43  
exactly what's gonna happen as well. They're all just gonna, like, sit down the

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  37:57  
senior in this I'll cut down the cheating. And anyone that manages to get through all of the cheer like needs to go to different industries, because there's a lot of effort. Yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  38:13  
first, fast. Okay, Alright, moving on to the next question. Which is question 12? How important is it that retail communications are recognised across different companies?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  38:42  
I Sorry, like, I

think this is a really important question. I just don't know if these are the people to answer,

Timilehin Tikolo  39:00  
like the owners or HR managers? No, no, Peter one, yeah. Like, I

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  39:04  
feel like recruiters are the best people to answer that question.

Timilehin Tikolo  39:10  
Um, true, I guess. Or HR managers.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  39:13  
Well, basically, yeah, we're asking, would you? Would you be prepared to recognise a standard in your hiring process, yeah. But then is it? Is there a point in asking this question? Ultimately, was even just

Timilehin Tikolo  39:28  
thinking about now, like, look, you're not asking for permission Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Like, to be honest, if the sun is dead, then they're gonna lean on like it's gonna be this one. Yeah? So we just have, like, hard hitting questions go on for too long, yeah. Industry wide. Education system is major retailer.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  39:59  
They would if they say they wouldn't

Timilehin Tikolo  40:02  
again, yeah, we can, let's, let's take Okay. Could you come into two training days per month, per store?

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  40:17  
Yes, this is based on our most recent chat.

Timilehin Tikolo  40:23  
So Bob this one? Yeah, yeah, I guess that's fine. We just need to explain this like maybe two on site slash in store, training days. Per month or so, because obviously, for them, they're going to be wondering, are you telling me I'm shutting my business down for two days? Do you know? I mean, they're going to be thinking, that's too much, and that would impact the answers. Yeah. I mean they wouldn't know that. What we're trying to say is, yeah, two hours, exactly yes, two hours, max per session or something, yeah, yeah.

And it's driven by the manager, and it's, I guess we can because so that they don't think we're the ones that come coming in every month to come and be training them to this.

Yeah, exactly. I saw it wrong with the G, yeah, no, this is correct. Now, yeah, with the J is correct. Okay, so yeah, yes, easily, yes to proper planning, possibly challenging to disruptive. Okay? What would justify the monthly time investment in training, measurable improvement, sales performance this time of satisfaction, personal development? Yeah, that's fine, yeah, yeah, that one's fine. How would you ROI? I

feel like 15 and 16 are the same thing, because, yeah, justification of investment is ROI, basically. So you go to because, you know, 16,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  42:43  
yeah, I guess the difference. I think we should keep both. I don't think we have to say both. I think this is one of those ones where, depending on the person you're talking to, you can do a blend. Because some people, you know, they're a bit they're getting a bit tired, and they just want set of options and other people you're gonna wanna, because someone who's got many locations, what they might say, like, Okay, two people might say all of the above, but another, ah, no, because they can still talk in 15, yeah, I Think 60 in Chicago. Just, it's just like, we know our people, yeah, okay, cool. So,

Timilehin Tikolo  43:30  
so delivery and implementation, rank this training tabs from best to worst team, yeah. Just wanted which delivery it needs to be changed, because

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  43:41  
it can't be dragged to rank. It's just like rank. And this is needs to be a numbered list. Now I

Okay, cool. Um, which delivery channel do you think is most effective and why? Sorry, you got to answer next one, yeah.

Timilehin Tikolo  44:31  
And these, we've done that one which delivery channels was effective, that's fine. Do you want to do WhatsApp slash telegram based? Or, um, oh, no. Need. Uhm,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  44:43  
because it doesn't matter, right? The truth is, if they say, what's up, I don't give a fuck. What's gonna happen is there's gonna they're gonna have a WhatsApp group, and there's gonna be a pinned message for a board, like a page, like what we're on now, because and that will link to a number of things, of which one of them will be telegram. There might be multiple telegram bots. There might be a general news one for all of our alumni. There might be a, do you know, I mean, but if anyone doesn't understand Telegram, or they saw some stupid article about, you know, the founder, I don't need the hysteria. I just, if anything, I could just say chat based in chat based training, yeah, will they understand message if I say, if I said to you, message driven or message based training, which one is more obvious,

Timilehin Tikolo  45:43  
like, which one more makes more sense intuitively? Message No, no, definitely just do WhatsApp base, okay, because you had it before, like you said, yeah, if not, they'll be so confident.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  45:58  
Okay, fair, I think. Okay. Cool.

I don't know care why they prefer it,

Timilehin Tikolo  46:17  
which on the

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  46:19  
19, I want

Timilehin Tikolo  46:22  
to get Yeah Or Yeah. I think we should take it out yeah, because what we're doing is yeah is what we're doing. More we're doing is essentially a mix career progression. Do you currently have clear current production partners for retail staff? I I have a question about this.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  46:46  
You'll know, or I definitely will not, is in asking this question, is it a bit political, because it's something that you should have, and if you've hired an HR manager, you should have so we're kind of like putting a spotlight on their job, or will they do, you know? I mean, will they welcome this, or will they will it cause a bit of friction?

Timilehin Tikolo  47:10  
No, it wouldn't cause fiction. It's just that, to be very honest, it may not be honest to themselves, and most people probably say yes, well defined, whatever, because they feel like they have KPIs sitting somewhere, and they feel like, oh, yeah, there's, there's a structure. But in reality, you know, I mean, it would, because if they think of it, they'll be thinking, oh, like, in the store, there's an entry sales associate, there's a store manager, there's a supervisor, there's an assistant manager. That's a clear structure of progression, um, but then beyond the store, that's when it gets, like, blurry, because in different companies, say, for example, in smart market, like our booze families company, once you've been like, store manager for but that one's based on, like, the size of the business, because they have so many stores and brands usually, like, if a high performance store manager after, like, quite a few years, you could then become like an operations manager for the brand, or like an area manager, but that's for a business that has this scale, for a business like our structure, you guys one store, you could end up being only store manager for ages because, like, no one is moving, like, if, if, like, the head of commercial, for example, isn't leaving, or whatever, like, you can't really go up.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  48:34  
Do you think? Do you think that it is valuable that for every organisation that we on board. We have

Timilehin Tikolo  48:44  
organic brown, like a recommended retail sales organ organogram, yeah, no, no, the current organogram. Or we ask them for their organogram, yeah, yeah. We can ask them part of the yeah to see, even though, hold on, sorry, one sec, but actually, yeah, there can be value in that, just to know the levels and the progression. Yeah, I guess so absolutely,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  49:10  
they could be fooling themselves, and it could make us do a bunch of work when, like, actually, the reality is very different. Or if they said, but I don't know, is making them submit an organogram, as opposed to just asking them questions about how their business is structured. Like, we don't want to add too much friction, and then we have, do, you know, I mean, we have a bottleneck, which is the organogram step,

Timilehin Tikolo  49:32  
yeah? And I don't want them to be like, having to send us some documents and stuff, and then they feel like, oh, this training is just not starting. They're just taking information, yeah, yeah. I hear you, actually, I hear you. I hear you, yeah. That might be too much complexity. We'll just

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  49:49  
have to ask them. We'll just have to have a rough one and send it to them, and they can just be like, that's wrong, that's shit. That's wrong, that shit. We'll do it for them. And then they get, they get an organogram back as, like, one of the nice assets,

Timilehin Tikolo  50:04  
yeah, like a proposal canogram,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  50:06  
yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  50:15  
to be honest, right to Be honest, this, this particular training that we're talking about is a store level training. So all we need to do is not even focus too much on like, what the head office structure is like right now. We need to focus on what the store structure is like. And to be honest, in that in that realm, there's not many different structures. It's literally like three levels at best. Like, you know, we can have depending on what we can give them, like three templates, and they eventually decide which one they want to do. But it's not going to be farm. It's not going to be much more than, like, salesperson. Do you know what I mean? Assistant Manager, manager. But then, obviously, if you want to now make it eventually, somehow and again, everything can tie in nicely, just eventually. I am not trying to, like, put too much on our plate at one try. But if we said, Okay, this is what we believe your ideal store structure like in Nigeria, right? Or whatever, as we're standardising this whole thing, this is what we believe every store structure should be like. We should have sales associates, a store money assistant manager and a store manager, but also the sales associates have a secondary role, and we can say, whilst an entry level sales associate, or whatever, or you're a sales associate after the entry level, maybe, like you're an established sales associate, whatever you should then one of them should be, do having a should have a second role as a, let's say, as the inventory lead, like that. One needs to be looking at what's selling and what not having an idea another one needs to be looking at visual merchandising, and should be looking at how the store looks and feels. So that then for us, obviously we're proposing that they have the structure in their stores. But ultimately, the bigger play is when we eventually get to then start building all the buyer, merchandiser, head office training, maybe with lbs, maybe on our own, whatever it is. We can also know that we have a pool of people from the store that have been picking interest in these things. So we can visual merchandisers in the diary, ready in the roles. But we can also start thinking of how we're gonna train those store people that have been doing visual merchandising and store to go into those roles as well. Do you hear me? Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  52:49  
and I so

Timilehin Tikolo  52:52  
it could be worth I think what we could end up doing is just giving them an organo Yeah, that's

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  53:02  
not you're seeing as well, right? So actually, maybe, maybe, like, I should be taking checkpoint, because if you think about how we are building this business, and we think about how you, you've seen other businesses go, I assume a lot of the time there isn't as smooth of like, uh, talking to something you can see or interact or has been updated. And I feel like that's another like, that's another USP that we have lbs can have 1000 conversations. Their website hasn't changed. Ours can change every five conversations, and that is like the world we live in now. Like we, because we, even if you think about pivoting, we've done that quite well.

Timilehin Tikolo  53:56  
Yeah, I think, yeah. I think I agree. I think we should. We should give them the organogram. Um, so that's something that we can I mean, obviously this would be in the there's a

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  54:08  
sales transcript, sorry, essentially, it's a sales tool for later, selling those trainings for those roles.

Timilehin Tikolo  54:16  
Yes, yes. So we need to make sure that businesses already recognised those roles in some way, even if it's just in a secondary capacity. They recognise and the people can see progression in those roles, and eventually they would see the career path when they see their certification, and there's a pathway to become something else in the company, yeah, and that's what we're bringing to the industry. We're opening up the industry. We're standardising it. We're creating pathways, or creating training. I think then, like it's, I like, we're changing it from the base, which is the organogram,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  54:54  
yeah, good, yeah. Okay, so then we're saying that, but we are deleting question 20. Is that as we were saying before? Right?

Timilehin Tikolo  55:06  
QUESTION Well, number 20, yeah, yeah. Okay, cool. Well, motivate you to invest in higher level retail qualification for staff. I stuff,

I feel like question has been asked. There's something about, like, imput sales, ROI, I think, yeah, so question 15

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  55:36  
was, what would justify the monthly time investment, yeah. Okay. Which question do you think is better? Because you can do one of them. I think question 21 is better than question 15. The options are kind of the same, but I mean the question,

Timilehin Tikolo  56:01  
yeah, yeah, let's take out. Yeah, angry, let's take out 15. Alright, cool. Sorry, one second. Hold on, bro. Hello, morning, yeah, morning. Officer, um, blessing is at the gate. Abby, yeah, please let her enter. You.

A Nike Hold on. A few minutes, please. This actually wait how many more questions we have? Okay, 33 okay, no, a lot more. Someone on my gate. It's the lady that comes to do, like my facial she's here, but I want to just questions, but just before, so I'll tell her, I'll tell her to hold on before, like, I want us to actually finish the question, because we need to do the interview at 12 with the question. So we'll definitely finish this question, but just hold on right now, because shadow is outside here with me. Yeah, put that into in the room before The woman comes up. Let's hold on a sec.

Mr. Coker,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  58:53  
yeah, You

Timilehin Tikolo  59:13  
set up

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  59:28  
I Just need court order That's

Timilehin Tikolo  1:00:15  
This you Coker. Hello, all right, sorry. So one question are we on? Question 2020, I've missed it. Okay, quite a few now, 1718, is fine. 21 Okay, so we kept 21 Yeah. Then now question 20 How would you budget annually per employee for professional? Okay, this is a good question. But those options, can you hear me? Yeah, okay, these options of we need to see clear arrow eye first, and depends on the role level, I feel like they'll just cop out and take those. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:01:55  
yeah. I don't like those ending ones, yeah. Okay, cool. How do you currently, well, actually, first, Oh, do we want to go higher than two? Like, do you think that they will do that?

Timilehin Tikolo  1:02:17  
Not for a so, no, no, no, no, they would do not for a logic. I mean, this one, anybody that even says that would be like for senior, very senior role, which is not in the store, right? He's gonna be like a, you know, like a head office, like head of So, really, it should, it should be

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:02:38  
like this. There's no point us even having two emperors, yeah, okay,

Timilehin Tikolo  1:02:44  
cool, so, but this is employee, yeah, that's fine, yeah, play, play, yeah, yeah, because essentially,

or do we give them an another entry level thing, like 100 to 200

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:03:13  
I think We have to think about like, because, what 100k and 100,000 and about like 64 bucks. Yeah, let's just call it 65 bucks for a year. To some it depends. It depends on what I don't think it can be too cheap, because considering what they want, like, like, what you're gonna pay 100,000 for a training, that means you're gonna make You're right. I

Timilehin Tikolo  1:03:54  
just worked out because I just did. I didn't divide it by 12. I forgot I didn't divide it by 12. I forgot I was per year.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:04:04  
Oh, yeah, I'm looking at it, and I'm like, for the effort, because if everyone's like, 100k bro, like, I can make a PDF.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:04:13  
Yeah. No, no, no, yeah. Sorry, I just, I just read that. I didn't divide this. I didn't divide it by 12, but then, um, because what I was looking at was essentially, yeah, I think, and I was looking at average salaries in retail, right? So I was like, okay, obviously there's higher paying like businesses, like our structure or whatever, but like, on average, like general sales associates probably on like, what? 121, 50. Do you know, I mean, on average. So I was looking at that like, Wow, are they going to be paying more than their salary for training. But then dividing it by 12 is like, yeah, it's like, it's not even 10% or whatever. Yeah.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:05:03  
Yeah. And then the pricing, for example, okay, let's say we, we land on 400k

per employee. That's two $50 today. Over free, and we say an average of what, 10,000 associates

Timilehin Tikolo  1:05:30  
per business, yeah, yeah, if they Yeah, well, yeah, oh. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:05:46  
I think it's, I'm just thinking about it now, because it's good though, because if, for example, a standard contract is 4m Right, like, yes, they, because AI is doing a price collapse, they do get, they do still get, like, a much superior service, but, like, there's an extent to it, right? So for 4m Yeah, because, okay, we want to sell, like, okay, okay, let's do some let's do some numbers. 400k Wait, can I talk numbers around speaker?

Timilehin Tikolo  1:06:27  
Yeah, you're on speaker, but yeah, you go through numbers.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:06:32  
So 400k yeah, that's four. That's four. But let me just do so if a average. I'm not going to say 10, I'm going to say 7.5 in sales associates, that's three 400k times 7.5 is 3m Right? So, 3m 3m is like just on $2,000 it's like 1900 mm. I'm just trying to chart a path. I am trying to see if the actor, if the unit economics, makes sense. So let's say, let's say, um, it's freedom of Paul, okay, let's say, let's, let's put, what's a product today?

Timilehin Tikolo  1:07:20  
What's the one a product,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:07:21  
it's like 120 right? Uh, yeah, yeah.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:07:25  
And, well, maybe like, yeah, or it's yeah, 180 2120,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:07:34  
okay, 120

Timilehin Tikolo  1:07:38  
or even, like 90, even. But yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:07:42  
okay, let's Okay. Let's put a round 100 100 Yeah, five by 333. 33 clients signed up, right? 33 clients signed up with 7.5 if it was all sales associates is a cohort, but broken down into 33 pods of 200 roughly and 50 students. I'm because you see what I'm trying to think what? What is worth the number? If it's 400 total, so 400 across all of their staff, no, four, yeah, 400 per person per year, on average, 7.5 people, which is where you get the 3m and then just as 100 m, it's 33 clients at this 7.5 staff, that's 250 what kind of system makes sense for 250 people? Okay, I'm gonna it's not a now thing, but like, it will help. It will help inform how much and how like evergreen, for example, we want things because 200 like, for example, marking 250 people, or managing the calendar for 250 people, or not managing the calendar, but collecting the feedback from two training days. Because what that means is, then, for example, 33 people, 33 clients.

Times two. So that means that each month, if we had So, if we had made roughly around 75,000 US dollars from this, we would also be if we decide, for example, to continue with this when you have your training days like, we will help you. We will give you the the insights you need to, like, run a good training day for two hours. That would mean we're doing 66 of those. 75 Do you feel, I mean, it's like, Ah, that's a lot.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:09:55  
Okay, after you're gonna go into these numbers properly later, yay.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:10:02  
Anyway, it's an ongoing thing, but now that I feel like we're gonna Yeah on this options, I think we'll come back. So maybe we don't say it to this Adidas person, because also adidas has got much bigger budget, maybe we asked them a ballpark today. Okay, yeah, because I don't want us to pigeonhole ourselves again a lot anyway. How do you financial training translates into actual variable changes on the shop floor sure happens after your team completes training. What specific actions do you take to ensure they apply what they've learned? Given give us a sorry, so I'm moving at the same training and your follow up process. I feel like that this second part is too long. Yeah, it's too quickly.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:11:07  
Just the question 23 itself is fine without the they would get it. They would answer as best as Yeah, okay, so just delete this.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:11:22  
Okay, no worries.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:11:24  
Then, would you be open to using mystery shop as supervisors? Okay, that one's a good question. Quality contract Sanders, would you be would you support biennial industry examinations to maintain? Yeah, to say, good question. On button is third party validation. I don't

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:11:52  
know if they're gonna understand that question. Yeah, probably

Timilehin Tikolo  1:11:56  
take that one now. Yeah. I

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:12:09  
would you value a system that provides detailed analytics? They're just gonna say yes, but like now, so Okay, here's a good example for what they are paying, they don't deserve this.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:12:24  
Which one is value, value system,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:12:27  
a detailed analytics on staff skill development, like I didn't pay baby,

Timilehin Tikolo  1:12:32  
yeah? No, that's us even too

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:12:34  
much. Yeah, I think you just removed this one. It was just maybe you get a nice surprise. Some people that as a thing would be, but like,

Timilehin Tikolo  1:12:46  
numbers matter. Yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:12:47  
this is important. Yeah,

Timilehin Tikolo  1:12:52  
even the most people kind of say all the above, but yeah,

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:12:56  
yeah. But whenever they say all the above, you need to be like, Okay, tell me your top two then

Timilehin Tikolo  1:13:00  
yeah, but then sales numbers, yeah, yeah, that's fine, but I need to change the question from sales numbers to maybe, what, what metrics matter the most? Because, like, customer satisfaction scores are sales, staff, retention, return, sales number.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:13:19  
I mean that, yeah, yeah, true. The 29 one is the one where they're gonna give us real stories.

Timilehin Tikolo  1:13:30  
Journey nine, share time and Trini actually improve. Yeah, okay, that one is fine.

Nicholas Folarin-Coker  1:13:42  
My Tracy, you use to assess those I thought we asked this before

Timilehin Tikolo  1:13:47  
we've kind of asked it even on 28 maybe. Yeah,

this one, this one was good. Day one, what support would your organisation need to implement a certification system, manager training organisations, yeah, as you know what one thing I will say is that a lot of this, like, for the pricing to work and be Affordable, the managers have to do, like, actual work. Like, if the managers aren't doing the evaluation, my first like, it is possible for them to send it, and AI is a thing that, like, collapses the price. Like, it's not it's not impossible, but like, will that lead to bad implementation in real life, that's the only thing, because it's obviously quicker for them to answer things in a digital way and have a digital assessment, which is almost instant, and then the manager look at that, for example, as opposed to this is how you can tell someone is engaged in a video. This is the rubric, or answer scheme for the questions based on the training that this person has been getting, like they're basically becoming teachers now. And obviously that's not, I don't know how much, because how many managers are actually, you know, vested in the development of their staff, as opposed to just seeing them as people that go and do this for me, especially outside of Lagos, because let's assume that we're gonna have a 5050, split of inside and outside of Lagos.
