#### 1. Executive Summary

FORJE and Lagos Business School (LBS) propose to launch Nigeria's first self-paced, AI-enhanced Fashion Retail & Service Programme, focused exclusively on Nigerian fashion retail. The five-pillar curriculum equips mid & senior managers with a rigorous, Nigeria-specific foundation in buying, merchandising, sales leadership, inventory & supply-chain, and retail analytics—delivered under the LBS brand, conferring prestige and immediate employer recognition.

#### 2. Purpose & Positioning

- Close the talent gap in Nigerian fashion retail by delivering rigorous, localised, on-demand learning.
- Leverage LBS's academic credibility to create a recognised certificate programme.

• Provide flexible, role-based pathways so unit heads upskill in key areas, while senior leaders gain holistic expertise.
