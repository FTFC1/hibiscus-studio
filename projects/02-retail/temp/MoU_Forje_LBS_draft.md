• **Platform** – any bot, website, cloud storage or software used to host, distribute or administer the Programme.  
• **Pilot Period (Initial Term):** 3 months commencing on the Cohort-1 launch date.  
• **Net Revenue** – gross learner fees **minus** direct payment-gateway fees and hosting charges incurred for the cohort.

## 3. Intellectual Property & Licence
1. All IP in the *Content* and *Platform* is and remains the exclusive property of **Forje**.  
2. Forje grants **LBS** a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence** to use the Content and Platform solely for the Programme during the Term.  
3. LBS may not reproduce, adapt or sublicense the Content without prior written consent from Forje.

## 5. Revenue Share & Finance
1. Learner pays fee through agreed gateway (e.g. Paystack).  
2. **Direct Costs** = payment-gateway fees + hosting charges only. Faculty honoraria, if any, are borne by LBS.  
3. After direct costs, **Net Revenue** split **60 % Forje / 40 % LBS** (subject to future mutual revision).  
4. Settlement to LBS occurs within **30 days** of cohort completion.  
5. *Illustrative Year-1 projection*: 330 learners across three programme tiers *(Executive ₦650 k, Management ₦400 k, Entry ₦250 k)* generates ≈₦124 m gross; after direct costs and a 60 / 40 split this yields ≈₦69 m to Forje and ≈₦46 m to LBS (see Revenue Projection Appendix).  
6. **Early-Exit:** if the Programme is terminated mid-cohort, learners will be refunded pro-rata for undelivered modules from the gross fees, and remaining Net Revenue will be split per clause 5.3.

## 6. Costs
