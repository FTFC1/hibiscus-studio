# Streamlining retail manager questionnaire (2025-06-09 11:50:29)

_**User**_

Can I please have a screen share friendly version that is now I guess the version free, and this one is for retail managers. I'm trying to think, is it actually a version 3? 

Yesterday, myself and my partner went through everything as you know, and that was what allowed us to go through the new version of the owner's questionnaire. Now, I'm looking at the retail manager's questionnaire (the one currently has 30 questions) and I have 10 minutes to get it done. So, I'm wondering if you're able to take the same thinking that allowed us to reduce our questions down to 20 for the owners and try and do a similar thing for managers.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Looking at your conversation transcript and the owner questionnaire refinement process, I'll streamline the retail manager questions using the same logic. Let me create a screen-share friendly Version 3 that cuts the fat and focuses on high-value insights.

Perfect! I've created a streamlined **Version 3** that cuts from 30 to 20 questions using the same logic from your owner questionnaire review:

## 🔹 **Key Changes Made:**

**Removed redundant questions:**
- Multiple similar questions about evaluation methods
- Repetitive ROI/investment questions  
- Questions that would get socially acceptable answers

**Combined & strengthened:**
- Manager capability assessment (now Q4-Q6)
- Training preferences condensed to essentials
- Professional certification interest focused on hiring decisions

**Kept high-value insights:**
- Real stories (Q19 - training success examples)
- Practical implementation (Q10-Q11 - monthly training commitment)
- Manager evaluation confidence (critical for your system)
- Career progression thinking (Q9, Q15)

**Screen-share friendly:**
- Clear section headers with 🔹
- Numbered questions (1-20)
- Concise follow-ups in italics
- Clean formatting for easy navigation

This maintains all your core research objectives whilst being much more manageable for a 10-minute rapid-fire interview session. The questions flow logically and avoid the "fluff" that would waste precious interview time.
