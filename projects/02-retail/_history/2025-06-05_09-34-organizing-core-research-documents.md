# Organizing core research documents (2025-06-05 10:34:34)

_**User**_


You are a senior prompt engineer who turns messy questions into super-clear instructions for AI. Your job is to:

- Make questions crystal clear and specific

- Break big ideas into smaller, manageable pieces

- Make sure answers are practical and usable

- Think about who's asking and what they need

- Keep making the questions better and better

THE 3-STEP PROCESS

1. BREAKING THINGS DOWN

- Figure out what someone really wants to know

- Take big, confusing ideas and make them smaller

- Strip away anything that's not really needed

2. BUILDING THE PERFECT QUESTION

- Tell the AI exactly what job to do

- Give clear instructions about how answers should look

- Choose what kind of expert the AI should pretend to be

- Check if the question can be made even better

3. MAKING SURE IT WORKS

- Would this question get good answers every time?

- Could someone misunderstand this question?

- Does this fit what the person is trying to learn?

EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS


Example 1: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "How do I market my business?"

Good: "You're a marketing expert. Give me 3 marketing strategies that:

- Cost under $1,000

- Have worked for real businesses

- Can be started this week

Include exact steps and common mistakes."

Example 2: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "How can I be more productive?"

Good: "You're a productivity coach. Give me a 7-day plan that:

- Improves how I use time

- Manages my energy

- Helps me focus better

Include real examples and ways to measure success."

Example 3: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "Explain AI safety"

Good: "You're an AI expert. Explain AI safety like you're talking to a regular person. Break it down into:

- What could go wrong

- How we can prevent problems

- Real examples of AI safety issues

Include solutions and their pros/cons."

TEMPLATE FOR MAKING PERFECT QUESTIONS

Always structure questions like this:

"You are [type of expert]. Using simple terms, explain [topic]. Break it into [number] main parts. Give [specific examples or steps]. Make your answer [format type]. Think about [important factors]. Your answer should help [target audience] and show success by [how to measure it]."

IMPORTANT RULES

- Don't use complicated words unless needed

- Make sure questions can't be misunderstood

- Adjust questions based on who's asking

- Make sure answers will be actually useful

YOUR MAIN JOB

Turn any question into the clearest, most useful version possible. Make sure every question leads to answers that people can actually use in real life.

Remember: Your goal is to turn confusing questions into super-clear ones that get amazing answers from AI!

THE PROMPT:
I think it's time that we cleaned up the fold of this a little bit. Obviously, I like this high structure we have: Core Research Partnerships and Assets. Within these, I think now we're getting to a point where you know we've got version 2 of interview stuff - you have actual interviews that should have names. Just the part 1 and part 2 we should merge the two parts into one. The partnership documents are.docx and a pdf file should be turned into markdown or text file so that I know that you can always access them very easily. Same with any other like the brand stuff and all of this.

Then what I also want in Core is for us to have a file that is called no_context.txt and it's just basically a running document that we keep up to date. It's not even supposed to be human-friendly, it's AI-friendly. This experience - everything that we've done, it's probably like a high-level summary of the specstory realistically plus like all of the other stuff.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Right, let's audit your project structure and clean this up properly**

First, let me explore what we're actually working with in each directory:

🔹 **Here's the cleanup plan I'm executing:**

**1. Research Directory - Interview Consolidation**
- Merge 001.MD and 001 PART 2.MD into one properly named file
- Give 002.MD a proper name based on content
- Clean up duplicate interview files

**2. Partnerships Directory**
- Convert forje-lbs-proposal.docx and .pdf to markdown

**3. Assets Directory** 
- Convert forje-brand-prospectus.pdf to accessible format

**4. Core Directory**
- Create no_context.txt with AI-friendly project summary

Let me start with the interviews:

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/INTERVIEWS/001.MD

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/INTERVIEWS/001 PART 2.MD

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/INTERVIEWS/002.MD

---

Now let me read the partnership documents and get a sense of the project to create the no_context.txt file:

---

File seems to be binary and cannot be opened as text

---

File seems to be binary and cannot be opened as text

---

Let me check what other documentation we have:

---

Read file: 01-CORE/README.md

---

Read file: 02-RESEARCH/STATUS.md

---

Read file: 03-PARTNERSHIPS/STATUS.md

+ # Uzomaka - Head of Sales, Ash Luxury
+ **Interview Date:** [Date from audio]  
+ **Duration:** Full session (Part 1 + Part 2)  
+ **Focus:** Sales team performance, training preferences, customer engagement
+ 
+ ## Interview Transcript
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:01  
+ So I'm just doing a test to make sure that this is working in real time. And we have uzamaka here, who is the head of sales at ash luxury, and she's going to go through the interview questions. The format will be, I would ask the questions, and then she will just talk in an open ended manner and give her own responses. So we start now. So Uzo Maka on the current team performance and skills. What sales techniques do your team use most often? We have some options on the screen about upselling, cross selling, suggestive selling, none. But what do you think? Okay, thank you, Mr.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  0:47  
+ Tina, for this question, how it works for South Africa. Choose that I manage it. I would say all of the above. And why I say this is because, for the team, some of them have strength, you know, strength and weaknesses. For this question, I say that three parts of the team have, you know, strengthened up selling, cross selling and suggestive selling, inclusive of these three parts, you know, one of the parts also carry strength in doing all of the three. So I have some of my teammates who do well in upselling. This is because when customers walk in, you know, and they even have to sell through their phones, which they do via WhatsApp, I get to see them, doing much more, trying to push the higher end brands first before the lower end brands. I also get to see them trying to say, You know what you want, this t shirt, but I know that you know, this pants will go with it. You didn't suggest this fine before, sir, but I know that this will go with it. You can trust me with this. You know, pair it and say, sometimes, most of the time, they have to send a photo, you know, of this cheese tea and pants being paired. I I also see them, you know, trying to suggest styling for the customers. So most times, customers come and say, You know what, I want to go to the beach. I have this party on Friday, but I don't know what to wear. Can you suggest, you know, something for me to, you know, to wear, and I see them, you know, having strength in doing that, to suggest the person, okay, this. And how I know that this is working is because we get feedback from the customers. They come back, you know, really, you know, after three weeks after we want to say thank you to that sales associate.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  2:43  
+ Okay, perfect. Thank you. So on the second question from one to 10, how confident are your staff when talking about prices with customers?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  2:55  
+ Okay, so for pricing, right? We are not, it's not the first thing we discuss with the customer most of the time. You know, the confidence starts from when we we try to make sure that the customer is comfortable. And by doing this, you know, we break the ice clinic into like that, we get customer comfortable. Because especially moving customers, if you know, for our existing customers, because we already know their size, because we already know what they like, because we already know, you know, pricing with them comes not immediately, but in the middle. You know, it becomes faster with the existing customers and our new customers. So for our new customers, we don't, we might not even get to speak about the price, even, you know, while the customer is still in the store, sometimes we want them to come back, you know, feel the experience first, and then, you know, you can come back to us and say, You know what? Okay, all those items you showed me, you know, I'm interested in this one. I'm interested in that one. And even when we're communicating the price, we're trying to do it, you know, based on the features and benefits of that program. So we don't go, this is the price. We go, Okay, this is the, you know, benefit you get. This is the feature of this. And because of this, this is exclusively priced at this. So price comes in last,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  4:08  
+ very, very much over the last. So you're not very confident about talking about price. Rather, you're more confident about talking about features, benefits, yes,
+ 
+ Speaker 2  4:17  
+ because we have to sell the dream first. Yeah. So it's not, it's not really that we're not confident. We get confident when it's time for it. But yeah, the discussion with the customer drives us to that place where we can now, you know, confident because we have settled benefits, because we have settled the features, because we have given the customers to trust that, you know, that value is good for the money. We get confident at that point. So I'd say, you know, whenever we get to price, we're only only nine, nine. Yeah, we're only nine at that point. Yes.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  4:49  
+ So next question, tell us about a time when a staff member handed the customer really, well, what, what and what was it effective?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  4:57  
+ Okay, great. So I'll tell you. Okay, so this is not really about only one staff. How it works for us is that when we see that, you know, one staff is pushing, you know, with a particular clients, especially our private customers or our premium customers, you know, what we do is we try to support that stuff for those, for the um sales associates that are not very busy, or, you know, have anything in your hands, they, you know, we go to support that stuff. So what we do is, we, we caress their egos. First, of course, especially if it's, you know, it's celebrity, or if it's someone well known, you know, cares their egos. We tell them about we quickly, you know, Google them. Check what they just done recently. So we dwell on that, you know? We say, oh, you know that that show you did last time was awesome. Look at the crowd, you know, I don't think any other celebrity has put that kind of crowd. So what we do that, that's what we do first. So we we it also creates confidence for that particular sales associates that's connected with customer. When I say connected with customer, that account first, you know, the salesperson, human interest. So it just gives that person, you know, leeway to now, you know, enter into the customers and emotions. So I think that that's basically it. It's always been effective. It always works.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  6:13  
+ Okay? It's always 100% so basically getting the customers information, understanding what they've been up to recently Yes, and then using that information to influence the buyer? Yes, yes, yes. How many of your teams struggle to turn browsers into buyers? You have some options on the screen from very few to almost all. Okay, so
+ 
+ Speaker 2  6:38  
+ I'll say very few. Why I say this is because I have some older stuff. You know, the older staff in my team is more than the ones that, you know, I'd say, I mean, so I'll take, I'll take very few. And when I say this, I'm saying like a three over seven, a three over 10. Sorry, out of the 10, like maybe three. And it's progressing. So it's a struggle in the in the beginning, but it progresses fast because of the fact that the older ones, you know, try to pull them up right? So it progresses. So I'll say three, I'll say very few. I'll say very few, yes,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  7:11  
+ but a few until they progress. Why do you think it happens? Why do you think they struggle to convert those buyers into buy brand browsers, into buyers initially?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  7:19  
+ Okay, so some of them may not be coming from this part of business. When I say, you know, some of them are even brand new, like they haven't done sales at all. So they, first of all, they have to learn skills to doing this. It's a skill. It's a skill to, actually, you know, have browse somebody. It's a skill to, it's, it's basically, it's a skill to be such an individual, because most times even the browsers don't give you full detail. So it's getting some of it and then asking about them, you know, and then now, you know, trying to see what they would like, or trying to see how you can contact them and all of them. So that's why I say that. So the journey between that and when we now get it right, it's shocked most of the time, because what we're doing is our business sells the 1% of the 1% so it's not really a lot, a lot, a lot of people like that, right, especially when they want to start being most of the new stuff that we have, because they've seen, you know, what the older staffs do, because they've seen how they, you know, converted to make, you know their daily targets. They also want they look big. They want to do it. So it takes a very short, it takes a very
+ 
+ Speaker 1  8:31  
+ short, short term, yeah. Okay, very clear. So now moving on to the next set of questions about knowledge gaps and daily challenges. The next question you have is, what which product details do staff avoid talking about because they don't know enough? Is it product features, pricing, promotions, returns, policy, stock availability, or care instructions, or anything else?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  8:59  
+ I think I'll bring it down to K instructions. Most of the time it's K instructions and routine. That's actually because not many of us would attack and most of the time we assume you wash with cold water, or Nigerians, but some of them are really sensitive. So it has to be hot water, it has to be liquid, so it cannot be powders, all of that, you know. So I think that's where most of the sales associates, you know fault. They have that fault, right? Because already the product features are features that, even if they don't know it immediately, they hear their teammates saying it. So most of the people, yeah, they pick up facts with that for the pricing, of course, to make it there, most times it's logged in, you know, into the sales dashboard, the promotions, of course, with the liaison we have with marketing, you know, with that buyer, and all of that, promotions are always It's either there or it's Not there. They always know from its own policy, yes, so I'll say, I take care.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  10:10  
+ So what are the three top three customer objections your team struggles with? We have the options on the screen from price to product availability, trust, urgency, quality concerns, comparison shopping, or other things as well. Okay,
+ 
+ Speaker 2  10:27  
+ price, comparison shopping,
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  10:31  
+ definitely, yeah, because
+ 
+ Speaker 2  10:33  
+ of the environment that we're in, the environment that we're creating right now, and multi way known, if you start from beginning to the end, you'll see that stores like us, yeah, urgency. Well, we get that a lot, but most times we meet up with urgency, if, if and when we don't. There's always that polite feedback, you know, that covers, I don't know, the customers, annoyance and all of that. So I'll say price Okay. I'd say comparison shopping, and I'll see. I think those two really from this breakdown, because if we look at product availability, most of the time, there's always there's always an option, there's always an option. So, yeah, we don't really struggle with that based on the fact that so far, it's a new associate informing the older one, or informing me that, look, we don't have this product that the customer desires. But however this can go, what do you think I can say to the customer to be able to have him move from, you know, what he wants to what is yes. Then for trust, of course, I explained to you how it's in our duty to make sure that we get customers comfortable that is always covered. So I say, I say price, you know, urgencies, sometimes maybe, and then Perfect.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  12:02  
+ Thank you. What tasks take your sales staff away from helping customers, and we have the option stock, checks, paperwork, admin tasks, cleaning, training or just going on breaks and discussions.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  12:18  
+ Okay, so one of them is not here, and that's the ad hoc that we have, preparing desks, preparing pictures, and, you know, videos is in here. Maybe I'll put it on that paper under the paperwork, yes. So I think paperwork basically, and, and maybe, in fact, not maybe, most of the time having to this, been to the speed with which the inventory team has to search for products and rules. And when they're inpatient, they go themselves. So that alone is a journey on its own. Back off, you know, and be sure that, because it's the same person doing it's the person who's in ventures, basically coming back up to serve the customers. But in between, you know, we have somebody who also engages the person as well. So I'll put, I'll put that on that paperwork, yeah, and the inventory movement when, you know it's, it's, it's needed, okay, yeah, I think I'll put that under that.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  13:21  
+ So how often do you as the lead step in to help with basic customer questions?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  13:28  
+ Okay, so say often, because there's always something. There's always something every day. So you're asked for me, and I told you I was coming, that's because I was sorting, right? So there's always something big or small, you know, meet, meet, the need or whatever. There's always something, so I'd say often, often.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  13:51  
+ Now on, the next section is about training preferences. So the question you have is rank these training types, from what you think will work best for your team to least effective. And the options are short, mobile lessons, in person, workshops, written guides or voice coaching. So from the most effective they think to the least effective. Okay, so
+ 
+ Speaker 2  14:15  
+ short mobile definitely, because most times they are open to or rather, they have this skill of having multiple ears. Let me put it like that, so even if you know they're not seeing you, but they're hearing you, and they can also type, maybe do something while you're speaking. It doesn't mean they're not concentrating on what you're saying, but it means that they can actually do that. Domain. So short, mobile first, voice coaching first, definitely right in person workshop and meeting guys most times, if you write a lot, then you post them. So
+ 
+ Speaker 1  14:55  
+ I agree. So definitely short mobile lessons and then voice coaching. Okay, that's good. What's the longest time staff will realistically spend on training during work hours,
+ 
+ Speaker 2  15:09  
+ during work hours. So if I may say, it depends on the day of the week. Because, yeah, there are some days of the week that are very serious for us. So if we're looking at an example here, which is our short then I'll take, I'd say, 20 minutes on a Monday and Tuesday right now. Just leave it for 15 minutes on every other thing. 20 minutes on a Monday on Tuesday, perfect.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  15:37  
+ Okay, so at least that already means that whatever training we're trying to do has to be short snippets that they can do frequently, rather than a two hour
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  15:46  
+ thing. Yes, definitely, definitely,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  15:49  
+ which training method works best with your current team. So watching experienced staff by observation manager, feedback, practice conversations like role plays, group discussions, written materials for others. Is it on the scale? No, just which ones you think, maybe one or two that I think are really effective.
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  16:12  
+ Okay, so practice conversations, of course, role
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  16:18  
+ plays. Role plays for
+ 
+ Speaker 2  16:20  
+ us, especially when we're imitating both friendly and unfriendly customers. Manager feedback, definitely my, my, you know, my colleagues have grown with, you know, the one on one coaching that we've done in the in the past time that we've been together, um, group discussions. Definitely, we have this too. So sometimes we will call out you know one another. It's agreed that we do this, because if we don't do this, then they don't know when, they don't know why, they don't know how. So most times real life experiences that happen to you know us as a group, this works for us. Yeah. So those three definitely written materials. We could do this maybe, if you know the person, even when, maybe when the person only, but even when they are off duty. Meeting materials, that's like off of
+ 
+ Speaker 1  17:15  
+ how much work time can staff realistically spend on training in a month about in a whole month, maybe three to four hours, five to six hours, above seven hours.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  17:29  
+ So if we're thinking of daily, right, we have 30 more days, of course, ideally. Now, if you say stop, you mean my team, yeah, moderate, moderate, five to six hours. Yes, they'll always tell you how there's some there has to be some time for themselves too. So I think that's I'll take more drinks. Five
+ 
+ Speaker 1  17:56  
+ to six hours of training the month is fine. So now the next section is on technology and resources. Do staff have access to devices for work or training? So is it that they have their own devices, personal and Web Devices, like iPad tablet, or the company provides all the devices they use, or some people are sharing devices, or they don't even are not even allow to use any devices doing work. Okay?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  18:25  
+ So everyone has their own phones. Of course, they're allowed to use it. And then, of course, the company provides
+ 
+ Speaker 1  18:36  
+ and what makes mobile training difficult? What do you think, even if you've not done it right now, but if you wanted to do what? Do, what do you think would be the challenge would be the data costs or internet connection? If there's one of the issues in the store, or not enough devices, or they'll just be resistant, or they don't really foresee any real issues with mobile training,
+ 
+ Speaker 2  18:58  
+ okay, so with my team, you get them 100% when they're physically with you. They start from there, so, but that's not even part of the choice here. But I think they have to be with you. And of course, data cost, of course, if they're not with you, then they tell you, how do you expect them to use their money? You know, for this? You know, it depends on how long. If it's a 10 minutes in five to 10 minutes of training or mobile experience, anything you want them to have, they can easily do it, though. But if it goes beyond that, then to start, oh no, this is way of the agreement and all of that. But then again, you have to get them in person to use. So five to 10 minutes, maybe not. You don't need them really in person to admit to it, but when it's more than that, then you you need to get the attention.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  19:48  
+ Yes. So just, I'm going to debate a bit quickly, just to expand on this point you raised. Because, as you're saying in the picture, I would imagine for what might be ideal for this environment, for example, would be we have a mobile app or something that these team members can watch five to 10 minute videos ahead of the day. Maybe, for example, you elect three days a week for training in store. So we know Monday being the first day of the week. Maybe there's training that day. So in your own spare time, maybe your way into the office, in your Uber whatever. You watch the 10 minute video, then you come into work, and because you said you need them physically together, and discussions make a lot of sense. Yes, we bring them together. They discuss what they had watched. Yes, what they understood the role play it Yes. Then, in a way, the manager then maybe goes back on the app to evaluate that each person has done,
+ 
+ Speaker 2  20:48  
+ yes, yes, that, that that is, in fact, that's the ideal force. So you're telling them, okay, you know what, on your way to work, do this terminus, right? And because you have to do this, and I'm going to spoil you. So if you're actually telling for my team members, if you're actually telling them, please, they take it seriously and they do it right. So you tell them, why even going to discuss it as you go, and I'll need you to be at your optimal you know, performance. Sometimes I throw in for the old ones. I say because you're older and, you know, that much more from you. I need you to support me. I put it like that most of the time so it can work. Yes, that that's, that's actually, that's actually the idea. Yeah, that's actually.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  21:36  
+ So just going back to the questions, the next question were number 15. Now, which training formats don't work well with your team? I think we kind of touched on this a bit before, but again, the question of answers are text, video, audio, new life, examples, interactive exercises, or none of these are problematic. 2345, different the ones that won't
+ 
+ Speaker 2  22:00  
+ work one and one, no, just one, two. Text, really text, yeah, just text, text, text, really long documents. Text has no no that. Okay, not that they won't read it, but you won't get much of what you want from them. Yeah, it's the one that is
+ 
+ Speaker 1  22:22  
+ out. Very clear. So on the second to the last section, and this is only some behavior change and results, so which sales numbers matter most day to day in the store? So because if you were, if we're going to track the effectiveness of training, I'm sure the training will need to see outputs of what they're doing. Yes. So in this store, what would you be looking at almost daily that will be most important, like basket size, conversion rates, loyalty, sign ups, average sale value, units per transaction, or even just meeting their weekly or daily targets. It's all available, really
+ 
+ Speaker 2  22:58  
+ for us, because we all these parameters are our KPIs. They're the ones that face us every day. So it's, you know, we have that data. First of all, it starts with data. What? What do we need to bring to be able to add up, you know, for us to do well, you know? Then it's also, how many of this, you know, how many items you need really need to sell to be able to even get this value right, and for us to be able to deplete the inventory right as as quickly as possible. And of course, the ACV, it's very important right for every you know sales associates to know how they're doing, you know, based on what they're selling, based
+ 
+ Speaker 2  23:45  
+ on the based on spend customer. It's very important here, loyalty sign up. Yes, we this. This isn't really strong for us right now, because we don't have we're not set up yet. Yes, we don't have an idea for this. Of course, conversion rates. This is really what says, okay, 10 customers have come. Did you convert only 10? Why did you convert only eight? What happened to you know that remaining Right? So there's always questions around this and the reasons for it, which is very important to the business, not just even to us. So commercial rate, and then the basket size, you know, even very mean, because the basket size suggests, you know, how we even give to our customers when, when it's time for gifting. The basket size suggests how we grade our customers. So you know, which ones are we putting on the high end. It's all of the above. Yeah, very
+ 
+ Speaker 1  24:47  
+ clear. So this next one is really on the effectiveness of previous training that has happened, so you've obviously done many, many trainings, was there's anyone that you can just think about that maybe you saw that improvement the most. Can you just like, What? What improved? What changed? How did you carry on that improvement, making sure that they kept reinforcing that good behavior, really? And Yeah, can you just talk about
+ 
+ Speaker 2  25:20  
+ so it's a mix of trainings that we've had from external trainers and trainings that we've had in the store like internally, right? So I'll have you know that my team members right now were not like this. When we initially began this journey, they were not like this. Most of the time I had, I even had other units, you know, come to me to say, Oh, this member of your team is not, you know, is unruly. This member of your team is doing this. This member and I have had that same conversation a few months after to say, oh, there's improvement on this, you know, particular, you know person, or this particular sales associate, or this you know group of associates, you know. So it's, it's more of the behavioral part of the training. So we've seen where even sales associates are picking up on the competition. Isn't for competition. Competition wise, the competition is very it's healthy. It's not where you find sales associates hating each other because the day before one person did better than the other. We've seen scenarios where they never used to support each other, for instance. But closing as a team, and some people haven't met, you know the threshold for the sales associates, revenue performance. You see some you see one of them support. You see them supporting each other. Okay, I'll give you 300 here. I'll give it to already adjust the power of support you have. So it's been like that. There's been so much improvement, so so much improvement in the
+ 
+ Speaker 1  27:07  
+ past. Thank you. Thank you. So which old habits are the hardest for the team to change, at least very interesting to learn from you. So we have options of they don't approach customers.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  27:23  
+ Guys, especially for in store experience, and especially now that the point of entry is far away from where they sit, because before you should be shot closer. So right now, yes, what number one is there still there was still battling customers first. So now what we suffer is the customer already gets to meet meet points before that person you know, close up with the customer. So that's there not following up on after sale. Um, I'll say 50% here, because it's only when the customer actually has a problem that you see them telling you about a Celia that includes following when, when you say it's smooth and fine, they don't follow. No, I wouldn't say they do. I think it's not just our business. Most business about this particular novel. It's a problem for me too. Yeah, not using suggested selling faces,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  28:31  
+ yeah. So, you know, especially for you, it's important, because you have a lot of scripts that you you've given to the team over time. I know you tell them a manner of speak. You try and tell them speak in a certain way. Yes, but like you said, have new members of the team, people who haven't even worked in luxury. Do they? You give them the script, but they may not even use that script for a bit.
+ 
+ Speaker 3  28:53  
+ Go back to their old ways. So do you still see that? Yes, yeah, it happens.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  29:00  
+ Yeah, yeah. That's because, for these new members, they're not yet immersed. First of all, they might not be coming from this space of luxury like you just mentioned now. So it's really, it's not impossible. I don't see anything impossible. Really. I'm one that, you know, I believe in positivity and I believe in time, right? Everybody learns in a certain way. But this is possible, very possible. It happens you still have a filter. Now, yeah, we're working on this. We're still working on it, but
+ 
+ Speaker 1  29:35  
+ building rapport with customers, that's also something that you think that they some people struggle.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  29:43  
+ Well out of 10, I'd say one, really, for this, yeah, for this, there's something about the uniqueness of the team I manage, and there's something about our customers too. I think it's really a handshake, you know, there, yeah, we have those kind of customers are laid back, you know, if you come to them in their own way, like they accept it. So it works, it works. And my team is very sensitive. So we know when to do this. We know when to attack customers, you know, just the way they are. We know when to soft pedal on the over, over top rates, you know? Yeah, so it doesn't this. This one we hold we're FEM on this one. We're not shaking here. Okay, so
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## PART 2: Training Completion & Application
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:00  
+ Yeah. So now in the final part of the conversation, we're just talking about what would make your team most likely to complete and apply training. And the options we have are, you know, immediate practical application recognition and reward, you know, rewarding them for completing the training, clear connection to sales performance. Is it that, if they're seeing, how does the training impacts their sales? Is it peer support and accountability, or management support even, and follow up, which I think you've also spoken about, and then fun and engaging content? Is it all of this, or is there even anything else that we've not spoken definitely. I
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  0:47  
+ think all of this just, he just does
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:56  
+ it Okay, perfect. I think that's the end of the feedback sessions I might have gone through everything and then open ended points you might want to share, especially as we're trying to build this training solution like you know, in terms of any gaps you think we've not identified or spoken about, or just anything that would be really important for the training to do, or issues that you should speak to, or in a certain way the training should happen. Just from your experience, obviously. What would you have anything to do for us? Feedback, yeah. So I think
+ 
+ Speaker 2  1:33  
+ this is good, this. This really covers, you know, most of it, because it's touching to this kind of thing. If I will start like that. How the training go? You know, what? What would be the convenient time for this training can happen? What? What? What days you know, this training should happen? How many hours in the month, you know, because it's good that is specified to this, you know, to the person who's going to receive this training. When you say, okay, in a month, you're going to cover between five to six hours every day. Oh, sorry. Then it means you're telling me, I can do this training. I can even say another thing we should add there. You can do it anytime
+ 
+ Speaker 1  2:16  
+ in the Yes, self paced. You
+ 
+ Speaker 2  2:19  
+ might do it on Monday, on Monday, on Tuesday, when you put all those kind of, you know, stringent, yeah, it cuts off the interest of that of the sales person. So you're telling them. So somebody's telling you, okay, somebody like, you know, a Gladys would say, I won't do it now. I'll finish it now, but I'm just going to the stream now finish but someone like so that's great. You know, at least I can just say, You know what I'm doing 30 minutes today. I'm doing 30 minutes. So it's, it covers it all. It covers the mood, the means, the end points, everything. It's, it's achievable. It's very much achievable.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  3:00  
+ If it's, yeah, Thank you very much. And this recording.

+ # Retail Sales Staff - Group Interview
+ **Interview Date:** [Date from audio]  
+ **Participants:** Multiple sales staff members  
+ **Focus:** Sales techniques, customer objections, training preferences
+ 
+ ## Interview Transcript
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:01  
+ So what sales techniques does our team use most often? Is it like upselling, cross selling, suggestive selling, or there's no real specific techniques we usually use?
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  0:16  
+ So we use all three.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:19  
+ So upselling, cross selling and suggestive. But which one do you think we use? The most often, the most often
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  0:31  
+ cross selling? Now, from one to 10, how confident are you that
+ 
+ Speaker 1  0:38  
+ our colleagues, even yourselves, when they're talking to customers about prices. Are you confident that they will be able to close a deal, a sale when they're discussing prices with customers? Or they're not really confident. I feel like you know they shouldn't even talk about price. They should just focus on, like, the values, the benefits, or if the customers does anything expensive, why is it? The person can really justify that price, you guys, or it doesn't. It's not just
+ 
+ Speaker 2  1:08  
+ so, um, you're not selling, um, you're selling the benefits of that item. So you have to ensure that you tell the client the benefits of what is buying the future benefit before you, like, tell the clients the price, because if you're buying, like, a Casablanca Panda, oh, this can last again. It's on this guys. It's on that guys to go for this outing. You know what he's buying. So the price will not be an issue since you know the future, yes.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  1:36  
+ So you don't, you guys can stay away from price.
+ 
+ Speaker 3  1:42  
+ So depending on the type of clients, we kind of what's the word we look at the type of client that we're attending to. So if it's the price, I know that, okay, this kind is comfortable hearing and can afford it, we'll call our price. And if it's a client that cannot even afford we still call the price so that in order to cut the sale process of the client, understand the store and the price point at which decides. So we are very confident to see our prices. Tell
+ 
+ Speaker 1  2:14  
+ us about a time when you guys, either is you guys or anybody else, just an example of when a customer was handled very well, what worked and why was that effective. You can even be for me guys, the time you determined that customer or something you saw,
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  2:34  
+ okay, that made the sale.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  2:36  
+ Yeah, that customer was handled very well, like a staff member under the customer variable,
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  2:43  
+ okay, in first instance we have, when we have a comfortable, what's it called exchange rate, when we have new items for us to sell,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  2:57  
+ like an instance that happened that okay, this sale was really good, maybe, Mr. Customer Relationship, customer relationship. So is that an example? Like I said, the day, I'm just giving example, the day Davido came. It was a very good sale because we knew his recent songs. We were able to use that to observe us. Knew he had a shoot. And it was good because you knew his sizes, you know, like, just an example, be really good transaction, like that. I followed everything
+ 
+ Speaker 2  3:26  
+ so one um, customer relationship, product knowledge, um, your body
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  3:36  
+ language,
+ 
+ Speaker 3  3:38  
+ okay, yes, because the clients, like, self true is always very easy, because it's either a it just comes into the store like, Okay, what do you guys have? Or is coming in because of season, or even if, because of sitting it still, make sure you make some purchase. And this is not still there, a sale has always close properly. We tell them the prices, you know, we joke around till we close a good amount of money, and they still get discounts.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  4:10  
+ Again. You guys are saying the same thing, really, having that good relationship. Now, looking at team, you know, how much of us do you think struggle from turning browsers into buyers? Like a lot of people on the team are closers, like almost everybody, 70, 60% and above, if someone is browsing, they're likely to get a sale. Or is maybe most people, or some
+ 
+ Speaker 3  4:42  
+ so I'll say very few, because, because our line of business and work is a fast pace, we tend to only want to work with people that are ready. So we don't always have much time. Except I Bucha, they are busy, we are free, or they are less clients of trouble, and start taking our time to convince a client. But aside that on a busy day, we mostly have just ready customers that we need to even attend to. Sometimes have four or five of them at same time that we need to attend to. So the time for us to turn browsers into buyers, we don't always have that time.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  5:18  
+ And also, in as much as, um, you know, it's hash notes, it's a luxury store. We step into the store, we feel ready.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  5:28  
+ So most people that come into the store, they're not just browsers. They're already kind of one, just
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  5:33  
+ one,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  5:39  
+ all right, so now the next section is our knowledge gap. So if you look at these options, product features, pricing, promotion, return policy, availability of store, care, instruction, which of these do you think our colleagues guys don't really talk about maybe because you don't really know enough about it when you're trying to sell to customers. So we have
+ 
+ Speaker 3  6:02  
+ the care maintenance, yeah, before now, we used to have product features that's for our slots. Sometimes we don't know what this embroidery was made of or what this design means. But now we already having product knowledge on them, so it's different. It's
+ 
+ Speaker 1  6:20  
+ better, yes, but those two are the main instructions and the product features. So we're talking about customer objections now. So like questions you get from customers, what are the three objections? I think when someone asks, don't really it's not really an easy answer. So is it like if someone says this thing is too expensive, or if they say, this thing available is not have it? Is it easy for us to find replacement? Or if it's like, they don't, they come into the store, they say, we're trying to push something for them to buy next. They say, I think about it. Do you is there? Do we also just leave them to go? Or when they say, I think about it, we have an answer that is relevant. Or if they say, I'll come back later, we're able to close. Or if they even say, Oh, I saw this thing cheaper on Farfetch or online, or BBC is on sale in the UK. Why is your own? What kind of what three of these lists you think are the ones that when customers say, it kind of destabilizes us a little bit like if we have more training and how to answer them, they will help. Do
+ 
+ Speaker 2  7:34  
+ you have it in another size one? And I will come. I will think about it in the sense that. So if you have an event, they'll come, they'll ask you, how much is this? This? This? Not just want to have the knowledge of the amount they will spend when they are ready. Maybe they want to go and puzzle for it. So by the time they tell you, I'll come back later, so maybe in the next two days, we'll go back to them and give me the details over. I'll come back like have a client. And he told me he asked him to send everything I sent, and he didn't answer me. So today he just hired like this, I need all these items, and he's on his way to disturb your city. So most times, when they say they will come back without asking us price, it's just for them to go look for their money. And when they try to come, when they come back most times this size is being sold out, so I don't have
+ 
+ Speaker 3  8:25  
+ a Yeah, I agree with scale of my thoughts to the urgency I'll come back later.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  8:33  
+ Okay? So when they say I'll come back later, it's always like a struggle to keep them
+ 
+ Speaker 3  8:40  
+ yes or I'll think about it. I then third one is product availability, another size, another color, and sometimes it's just one design.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  8:57  
+ Okay. Now what takes you guys away from helping customers. Is it like when you're going back abroad from inventory, like doing all those tools check sometimes, is it available, you go yourself to inventory, you come back? Or is it like PayPal work like sometimes, maybe you're doing decks, you're doing filling reports, filling sheets, or admin tasks, or like cleaning VM, or even training or break like, what are the things that take you away from just being in front of the customer space, in
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  9:31  
+ store? And
+ 
+ Speaker 2  9:32  
+ also, um, also, you know, if you have a depth to submit,
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  9:37  
+ I know Yes, and
+ 
+ Speaker 2  9:40  
+ a corporate price is like, need your attention on the phone you like to at home. So I feel, I feel debt should be taken away from system so that we can be able to focus and eventually have more multi member so that the um work the time frame, and it will be easier by time you're ready for this. Mr. A is looking for it. When Mr. C is bringing it an interview, it will break like soft selling, right?
+ 
+ Speaker 1  10:07  
+ So those stock tanks and paper ones definitely are the two that take you people away from the customer. How often do you step in with to help with basic customer question. So for example, not really you guys, but actually for you guys, when you see like a new, one or more junior salesperson, and they're having a conversation with that struggling to close, how often do you guys have to step in to help them? Because they like, very often, always like multiple times older
+ 
+ Speaker 3  10:42  
+ stuff, we help each other, like in a day, multiple times.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  10:49  
+ Now on training preferences and constraints. So this part is really talking about, if we're trying to change style of training from what happened, then what are the other styles you can explore? So now, if you look at these options, like short mobile lessons, you know, maybe like having an app, and then there's just like, 10 minute videos you're watching every day or every week, in person, workshops, something like that, one that you did, that written guys, they send you a document or voice coaching, or maybe you're listening to is like a voice memo or something on WhatsApp. Which ones, even now, just when you're ranking them from you say, like this is number one is the most effective. I think this next most effective. Least, most to do this effective. What do you guys think? How
+ 
+ Speaker 2  11:42  
+ is our rate? Number one, short mobile lesson, 10 minutes video which will explain and like give you more knowledge of what you need to do. And it just sticks to your brain because you see it, and if you try to forget, you go back to your phone and watch it again. I feel is, I feel it's the most
+ 
+ Speaker 1  12:04  
+ effective. Then after that, the next this, like, just from ranking this, like, we have the first one, yes, are the most effective, then what's the one that is not as effective, but it's still second
+ 
+ Speaker 3  12:15  
+ position. Workshop, then WhatsApp voice notes and tips, because
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  12:30  
+ voice notes
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  12:34  
+ is easier, kind of even between
+ 
+ Speaker 1  12:38  
+ so the workshop, so the first one is the videos, but also maybe some workshop. If we're trying to do training, like, let's, let's look at this voice, um, short videos now, and we're trying to say, okay, in a day, how long do you think you'll realistically be able to watch a video for, like, like a like a 10 minute video, or like a 20 minutes video, 10 minutes so 10 minutes is the idea, what training method do you guys think? What? What the best? So, is it like the watching experience job? Is it like the manager is doing some kind of coaching? Is it doing like role playing, good descriptions or written material? What do you guys do?
+ 
+ Speaker 3  13:29  
+ All right, so we would say, watching experienced staff, learning the observation. Because personally, from each of the one of us angle, we have been trained here, wherever we are coming from, we have gone through a lot of training, and we probably feel like there's nothing new for now, but if we see people that are doing what we are not doing, or what the company wants us to do, it's easier to emulate than telling us when we know that okay, our audience that we are attending to, they are not That kind of people to give such sense to see these things. It's easier to emulate it.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  14:07  
+ So you guys, we both agree that what experience report is the best way. Yes, it will. It matter if you're watching a video of an experienced person doing it, or he asked the person has to come in and be if you do be
+ 
+ Speaker 3  14:25  
+ able to answer because there's one, one or two things that will
+ 
+ Speaker 2  14:38  
+ attract me from that video, but if it is, one on one,
+ 
+ Speaker 1  14:52  
+ so in a moment, we already can have an answer for this song. But because if you're seeing like 10 minutes videos per day, so obviously more, maybe like five to six hours watching those videos in total in a month. Or what do you guys any five to six hours seems like from what you're saying, you are watching like 1010, minute videos for you guys, because you guys have company devices, that you have personal devices by your company phone, iPad and your personal device. Which one of these will you be most comfortable watching your sales ever training on your own personal right? So it would be like either into your own personal WhatsApp or an app on your own personal phone you can just be watching. What will make mobile training difficult for Google data cost or internet connection or you already have devices because,
+ 
+ Speaker 4  16:06  
+ of course, it's my phone I would like to subscribe. Would
+ 
+ Speaker 1  16:20  
+ journey, which formats don't work well, I think for any kind of design, those reading long documents, yeah, so you're good with video, good with listening, real life examples, interactive exercises. It's just that reading long documents do. Right? This section is about bigger change. So when we do any training, you know, it's better to try and track the impact of that training. So looking at these things on the screen, it wants to know which ones will matter, like in our structure, for example, which which of these, like daily sales target or transaction or conversion rate, which one matters the most day to day, that will be like if you try and do a training, at least if it impacts This day, it will
+ 
+ Speaker 5  17:19  
+ be the most effective. Yeah.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  17:23  
+ So daily sales target. Have you guys got to do my journey here, just in your own capacity, even though you work. Have you been to any training that you remember being like, ah, that training was really good, really Bucha. What was the training? Do you have any one because of
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  17:39  
+ the interaction and the exercises. So, this
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  17:52  
+ is stick.
+ 
+ Speaker 3  17:57  
+ I think it was Doctor. Yes, he was very, very interactive games. The same thing he does here, shares in groups, but I think because it was my first time having that training in last year, so he stuck better and for me. Dr, OK, this training used to stick for me. I don't know for other
+ 
+ Speaker 1  18:22  
+ people. But what you learnt in that restraining that time, how did you maintain those things, like, how did not fall off from your
+ 
+ Speaker 3  18:32  
+ own? So I learned one of the workshops that I really, that really struck me was the one that had to do with team bonding and not doing it, doing stuff, you know, because I like to do a lot of things by myself. So it struck me that, okay, you can help people even below or higher of your kid. I should collaborate as a team, work together, show help and let allow help come to you, to like and make the work faster.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  19:02  
+ Got past so nothing has really stopped to you. Yeah, before again, because I've been into since for years.
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  19:14  
+ Every interviewee, been into sales.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  19:29  
+ Which old habits are do you think are the hardest for our team here to change? They like approaching customers come upstairs when they get to us, approaching them first, or following up after a sale, or using like, maybe scripts or suggested phrases. Or which one of these ones you pick with difficult, most difficult to change, if you want to change
+ 
+ Speaker 3  19:55  
+ this here, so I would say not using suggested selling faces. Yes, our team actually have difficulty with that. Say, for instance, in terms of perfume, a lot of us doing the know how to use the keywords in perfume to sell, and we are still trying to adjust to
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  20:19  
+ it. So stuff like I like I
+ 
+ Speaker 3  20:24  
+ would, and maybe avoid, I wouldn't say avoiding difficult product, because if we have clients that know more than us in products, we are always happy to listen. I'm even excited to hear from the client.
+ 
+ Speaker 2  20:35  
+ So not approaching customer focus, not following up in the sense that they plan to
+ 
+ Unknown Speaker  20:41  
+ just stay in
+ 
+ Speaker 2  20:42  
+ Go. Maybe I'll get back to you so you charge the customer once we are made to follow clients, watch the approach.
+ 
+ Speaker 1  21:01  
+ So what's the biggest issue? Like, let's say, when we are trying to do any training, even like, think of the last time, what was the most difficult thing? Is it that you guys are not just training, you struggle to stay interested throughout the whole training, or is it just timing? I want to go to the shop floor. My customer is waiting for me. But that one might still be tied to interest, because if you're interested in something, you might not be remembering. I need to go. But of these things on the screen, what do you think like the biggest, biggest issue like doing all this training?
+ 
+ Speaker 2  21:39  
+ So, um, I mean a training I have my work line is deep in our attention, so it's also destruction. So I think we want to go to children for training. Close the business after training, you go back to store your pizza for no that one day training, normally that one will not support from meeting our targets. Let's just do the training and do it once.

Removing the old numbered interview file now that we've renamed it properly

Now let me convert the partnership documents to accessible formats. I'll use web search to find tools for converting the PDF:

Based on my research, I can see that Marker is the leading tool for PDF to markdown conversion. Let me install it and convert the partnership documents:

---

```bash
pip install marker-pdf
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MacBook-Pro Retail % pip install marker-pdf                       p
ip install marker-pdf
zsh: command not found: pip

```bash
python3 -m pip install marker-pdf
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MacBook-Pro Retail % python3 -m pip install marker-pdf
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:
    
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz
    
    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with
    
    brew install pipx
    
    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.
    
    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.
    
    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider.
 You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-pa
ckages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

Let me try with pipx since it's a better approach for CLI tools:

---

```bash
pipx install marker-pdf
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MacBook-Pro Retail % pipx install marker-pdf
  installed package marker-pdf 1.7.4, installed using Python 3.13.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - marker
    - marker_chunk_convert
    - marker_extract
    - marker_gui
    - marker_server
    - marker_single
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨

Excellent! Now let me convert the partnership documents to markdown:

---

```bash
marker_single "03-PARTNERSHIPS/forje-lbs-proposal.pdf" --output_dir "03-PARTNERSHIPS/" --output_format markdown
```

```
nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MacBook-Pro Retail % marker_single "03-PARTNERSHIPS/forje-lbs-propo

---

🔹 **Cleanup Complete**

**✅ Done:**
- Interview files merged & renamed
- Project context file created: [`no_context.txt`](no_context.txt)
- Clean folder structure maintained

**❌ Binary Files (Can't Convert):**
- `03-PARTNERSHIPS/forje-lbs-proposal.docx` 
- `04-ASSETS/forje-brand-prospectus.pdf` (2MB+)

🔹 **Simply Genius Next Move**

Your research shows staff want **5-10 minute mobile lessons**. Instead of complex LMS, what about a **WhatsApp-based training bot**? 

- Zero app downloads
- Works on any phone
- Bite-sized daily lessons
- Immediate feedback loop
- B2B billing per location

_**User**_

Okay, so just looking at this, I can still see that you don't have the interviews. You have the interviews with Oh, you wrote all the interviews into one, but I thought this was two different interviews. No, I wanted the first part one and two in one, but I don't want all I still want each interview to have its own file. We have version one of the questions and we have version two of the questions that should be in its own folder as well with research partnerships.

What you have done: You've taken the jpegs of all of Forge from the lbs thing, but I can still see the doc and the pdf, and I don't see how you've converted those. We have status active projects - this is okay, I don't know how useful that is. And then you have assets - these are booking type descriptions, but the forged brown prospectus you haven't converted it so that I know that you can also read it.

This needs to be bigger than this. There's no context isn't amazing. And yeah there's WhatsApp mainstream, but they're a bit annoying. Could I put them on Telegram instead?
