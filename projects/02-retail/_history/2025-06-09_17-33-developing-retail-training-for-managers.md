How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys
here. Let me message him so many of these today like I feel like you two got tired.
I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when a 
customer is like, pushing back. Like oh, for example, expensive. 
Yeah. What do you say because that's an objection to where you're sending because these streets are kind of like, oh no.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

# 🔹 Abu Interview - Key Intelligence

## 🔹 Critical Skill Gaps Identified

**Structured Sales Process Missing:**
- No opening → needs assessment → product demo → objection handling → closing flow
- "Shotgun" approach instead of methodical customer journey
- Lack confidence because no framework to lean on

**Behavioural Gaps:**
- Positivity/enthusiasm deficit 
- Cold shoulder treatment of customers
- Not building rapport or understanding needs first

## 🔹 Certification System - The Retention Dilemma

**Abu's Honest Take:**
- Loves transferable certs for hiring quality
- **BUT** fears training staff who then leave for better packages
- Prefers 2-year bonds (FDM model) or internal-only certifications

**Business Model Implications:**
- External agency supplying trained staff (you train, they bond for 2 years)
- Internal progression tracks tied to certifications
- Hybrid: transferable certs with retention incentives

## 🔹 Manager Evaluation Reality Check

**50% Confidence Rate** - Abu rates managers 5/10 for evaluation capability

**Root Cause:** Cultural/leadership issue, not individual manager competence

**His Solution:** 50/50 hybrid even at 3hrs/month time commitment
- Managers: maintain internal oversight & seriousness
- External: quality assurance & workload relief

## 🔹 Next Moves for Your Training Development

1. **Build the structured sales framework first** - this is the biggest pain point
2. **Design retention mechanisms** into your business model early
3. **Plan for manager training** alongside staff training (the 50% gap needs addressing)
4. **Prototype the hybrid evaluation system** - managers + objective tools

**Abu's Scale:** 275 staff, 65 managers (4.2:1 ratio) - good benchmark for your operational planning.

What's your priority - tackling the sales framework structure first, or solving the retention/business model challenge? 🤖

How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys

I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when 
a customer is, like, pushing back, like, oh, for example, your prices are too expensive, 
yeah, what do you see? Because that's an objection to where you're sending. You say, Oh, this should have kind of like, oh, no, they're too expensive. Like, how do they? What do you say? You know, like, in that position, yeah, 
honestly, I would say all of them, like, yeah, hard to pick one or two. 
I would say, you 
know, definitely just customer engagement and service, okay, and then store operations and procedures, because I think with those two, you can't make anything work. So that's interesting. So like, giving them clear store 
processes that, yeah, 
just those out of interest now that you can do your 
benefit from, like, almost a playbook, 
like, just as it says associates, when you come in the morning, you look through, for example, like the customers expecting in the day. You engage your between 10 and 11, you engage your customers. I bought last three months, for example. You call them with like, and they almost like, obviously, it will change publication and by reality and whatnot. But almost like a, almost like a an hourly playbook of what associate would should do in terms of if we're looking at like the operations. Do you think that would benefit them? 
Yes, 100% because these all sound like simple things, but I can assure you, you know the instances where people aren't like paying attention to those things, and it's making, like, a huge, it's a huge disadvantage. So, yeah, I would say, like, even if it's just a simple, like, you know, that's the first module, or something like, Yeah, I do think it's something that makes, that would make a difference. 
I see, I'm just gonna say this here, so that obviously you can 
also track it for later. But based on this, there could be something around, like, a nudge that we do hourly, you know, like for we would have taken certain buttons to a certain level. We could then, like, prompt them, like with notifications or whatever. Like, you know, have you done this engage? Have you followed up with your customers today, you know, stuff like that. We can think around not just, kind of just direct customer, um, citizenship behaviour or FTR you're 
talking about. 
Hello, hello, 
hi, wait. Can you guys hear me? Yeah? Yeah. I 
I think, I think FC is having some 
issues. 
Um, all right, Abu, let's just go on and then is that, sorry? Repeat, repeat. Wait, 
no, wait. Can you guys 
hear me? Yeah, yeah, okay, 
okay, it 
cut out. 
No problem. No worries, man. 
I was just saying for later, I was just like bookmarking something with you. I was just saying for later we should just look at how we can because Abu mentioned one of the key things that will benefit. The team will be like training on next door operations. And then we spoke about maybe, oh right, yes, yes, yes, the notification. So 
yeah, 
notifications, prompt, yeah, to nudge, 
action, 
yes, exactly 
like a morning routine, but it's a shortfall routine. Yeah, exactly. So then 
notification by noon to say it's now noon. 
Have you done? 
Okay? So I'm 
the assumption I'm making here, then is that salespeople are allowed to have their phones on shop floor. 
You do have 
CDTs. Yeah, location, yeah. So, 
yeah, different business. But, I 
mean, the store at least, like, like, in smart mouth, like, Abu said, like, the store has his phone, right? 
But obviously with the but I put the salespeople also have their phones with them, right? Like, the personal firms on the show, yeah, they do, 
yeah. So if they got a prompt on the phone, 
like, yeah, OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. Look at that, ft later. 
I'm gonna see if this customization. Question. 
But, just again on this standardisation thing again. I'm bringing up just because, you know, my touch on it earlier, about. how.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

# 🔹 Live Interview Intelligence - Circle Back Points

## 🔹 **IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS TO PROBE**

**Abu's "Dad Explained It" Comment:**
- He admits zero retail background yet talks confidently about sales structure
- **Circle Back:** "You mentioned your dad explained proper sales approach - what specifically did he teach you? Can you walk me through that exact process?"
- This could reveal if his insights are theoretical vs practical

**The 27-Year Business "Crash" Story:**
- Says standards dropped after strong early focus
- **Deep Dive:** "You said things went crashing down - what year? What caused it? Who made those decisions?"
- This is your case study for why training certification matters

## 🔹 **BUSINESS MODEL GOLDMINE**

**Abu Loves Transferable Certs BUT Fears Poaching:**
- He's torn between quality hiring and retention
- **Circle Back:** "If we guaranteed 2-year retention through bonds, what would you pay per certified hire vs current recruitment costs?"
- Get actual numbers - this is your pricing model

**The FDM Model Resonated:**
- He immediately got the concept
- **Ask:** "What other industries in Nigeria use training bonds? Who's doing this successfully?"

## 🔹 **MANAGER EVALUATION REALITY CHECK**

**50% Confidence = Cultural Problem (Not Skill Problem):**
- He blamed "top level culture" not individual manager capability
- **Critical Follow-Up:** "Who sets this culture? Are you saying senior leadership actively undermines objective evaluation?"
- This could blow open the real problem

**3 Hours/Month Video Review:**
- He stuck to 50/50 hybrid even with time commitment
- **Test This:** "What if it was 6 hours? 10 hours? Where's your breaking point?"

## 🔹 **OPERATIONAL INSIGHTS TO EXPLOIT**

**Staff Have Phones on Shop Floor:**
- Huge opportunity for nudge system
- **Build This:** Real-time prompts, daily checklists, performance tracking
- Ask about current phone policies across different retailers

**"Simple Things Make Huge Difference":**
- He emphasised basic operations training
- **Validate:** "Give me 3 specific examples where lack of basic procedures cost you sales this month"

## 🔹 **QUESTIONS THAT DIED TOO EARLY**

**The Standardisation Topic:**
- Interview cut off just as he was getting into this
- **Must Revisit:** His thoughts on industry-wide vs company-specific standards

**Objection Handling Gap:**
- He didn't know what it was but said "all modules" important  
- **Test:** Give him real scenarios - "Customer says too expensive, what should staff say?"

## 🔹 **STRATEGIC FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS**

1. **Schedule Round 2:** Focus purely on operational playbooks and manager culture issues
2. **Get Financial Data:** What does bad sales performance actually cost them monthly?
3. **Map Their Current Training:** What exists now? Who delivers it? How much do they spend?
4. **Competitor Analysis:** Who are their main staffing/training competitors?

**Most Valuable Next Question:** *"Abu, if I could fix just ONE thing about your sales team tomorrow, and it would guarantee 20% sales increase, what would that one thing be?"*

# 🔹 Money-Making Insights Only

## 🔹 **Direct Revenue Opportunities**

**Abu's Pricing Sweet Spot:**
- Loves transferable certs for hiring quality
- **Ask:** "What do you pay per hire now vs what you'd pay for pre-certified?"

Speaker 1 (100%)
How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys
here. Let me message him so many of these today like I feel like you two got tired.
I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when 
a customer is, like, pushing back, like, oh, for example, your prices are too expensive, 
yeah, what do you see? Because that's an objection to where you're sending. You say, Oh, this should have kind of like, oh, no, they're too expensive. Like, how do they? What do you say? You know, like, in that position, yeah, 
honestly, I would say all of them, like, yeah, hard to pick one or two. 
I would say, you 
know, definitely just customer engagement and service, okay, and then store operations and procedures, because I think with those two, you can't make anything work. So that's interesting. So like, giving them clear store 
processes that, yeah, 
just those out of interest now that you can do your 
benefit from, like, almost a playbook, 
like, just as it says associates, when you come in the morning, you look through, for example, like the customers expecting in the day. You engage your between 10 and 11, you engage your customers. I bought last three months, for example. You call them with like, and they almost like, obviously, it will change publication and by reality and whatnot. But almost like a, almost like a an hourly playbook of what associate would should do in terms of if we're looking at like the operations. Do you think that would benefit them? 
Yes, 100% because these all sound like simple things, but I can assure you, you know the instances where people aren't like paying attention to those things, and it's making, like, a huge, it's a huge disadvantage. So, yeah, I would say, like, even if it's just a simple, like, you know, that's the first module, or something like, Yeah, I do think it's something that makes, that would make a difference. 
I see, I'm just gonna say this here, so that obviously you can 
also track it for later. But based on this, there could be something around, like, a nudge that we do hourly, you know, like for we would have taken certain buttons to a certain level. We could then, like, prompt them, like with notifications or whatever. Like, you know, have you done this engage? Have you followed up with your customers today, you know, stuff like that. We can think around not just, kind of just direct customer, um, citizenship behaviour or FTR you're 
talking about. 
Hello, hello, 
hi, wait. Can you guys hear me? Yeah? Yeah. I 
I think, I think FC is having some 
issues. 
Um, all right, Abu, let's just go on and then is that, sorry? Repeat, repeat. Wait, 
no, wait. Can you guys 
hear me? Yeah, yeah, okay, 
okay, it 
cut out. 
No problem. No worries, man. 
I was just saying for later, I was just like bookmarking something with you. I was just saying for later we should just look at how we can because Abu mentioned one of the key things that will benefit. The team will be like training on next door operations. And then we spoke about maybe, oh right, yes, yes, yes, the notification. So 
yeah, 
notifications, prompt, yeah, to nudge, 
action, 
yes, exactly 
like a morning routine, but it's a shortfall routine. Yeah, exactly. So then 
notification by noon to say it's now noon. 
Have you done? 
Okay? So I'm 
the assumption I'm making here, then is that salespeople are allowed to have their phones on shop floor. 
You do have 
CDTs. Yeah, location, yeah. So, 
yeah, different business. But, I 
mean, the store at least, like, like, in smart mouth, like, Abu said, like, the store has his phone, right? 
But obviously with the but I put the salespeople also have their phones with them, right? Like, the personal firms on the show, yeah, they do, 
yeah. So if they got a prompt on the phone, 
like, yeah, okay, okay, okay, we can look at that. Ft later, 
I'm gonna skip this customization question for kind of spoke on it. 
But Abu just again on this standardisation thing, again, I'm bringing up just because, you know, we touched on it earlier, about how it will benefit the industry, and then you spoken about, you know, from a business perspective. But do you actually think, you know that standardisation overall would be useful, you know, to the industry? 
I know, like now, when looking at we're now looking at it not just for your like, your business, which makes sense, but like as a player in the industry, if everybody's held a certain standard and benchmark, does that ultimately help and plug some kind of gap that we're experiencing? 
Yeah, for sure. You know for sure. I 
think one thing I would say is that you have an organisation like smartwatch, you see some people who have spent, like, I'll just use the sake of store manager for an example, you know, they've spent like, 10 years in a row, you know, 
and like, it's just kind of like, there's no 
insight as to what they've picked up, or, you know, what is lacking, or what's the reason why they haven't progressed more than what they are? So, yeah, I think it's definitely important, absolutely, 
absolutely. 
I'm just gonna go to other questions I feel would 
be really important for you. One thing is, you know, obviously we're looking at how we can delivery, deliver, sorry, this, this trainings, and then we're a few options on the screen, from one to four, which would like you to rank one being sort of the most useful, most relevant channel for being the least relevant for the team. So we could just run from one to four if you thought, like if you think show mobile lessons would be great. If you think in person workshops are great as well, or written guides and voice coaching on WhatsApp. Yes, I think one 
in person workshop shops, two short, mobile lessons, 
three voice coaching, and the last written guide. 
Okay, perfect, and I am okay. That's 
great. Okay, cool, um, 
and then what would motivate you? Quickly? Yeah, 
oh, okay, cool. I think there's a lag on so yeah, I can, I can hear Abu 
when you say voice, the voice training in your mind. What does voice training look like? 
Like if I, if you, someone told you, oh, we bought one thing, and it's been implemented tomorrow. What? What would you think you would see? 
Um, you know, short voice notes, like, not more than, like, a minute, 30 seconds long, yeah, and 
not too intricate. So it's not like it's teaching you certain things, you know. It's just like maybe reminders or prompts, or you understand and explaining the importance of all those things. So, you know, I would say more, more it's like a guide than anything. You know, that's kind of why I sort of put that three as three. Yeah. Okay, cool, and thank you. 
Cool. Um, 
I think we've spoken on this motivation already, so my skip that. Uh, one thing to ask Abu, not necessarily to get the ball back on the corner, but do you have an annual training budget that you work. 
No, we 
don't really know you. 
Okay, so the trainings that you guys 
do are they stop us 
through what you currently do so that 
we can also how we can plug in or optimise that process of what we're trying to, you know, so it's more 
brand, 
brand focus. So our partners, they give us, give us stuff like trainings on more the product than the processes. And, yeah, so it's very product focused, either they when, when we get new collections, New Seasons, you know, they want to train to explain to the staff what this products are all about. So, yeah, it's more, more brand driven from a global perspective. And it's not really market. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Yeah, I think that's that's good feedback, because one of the guys who interviewed earlier was also saying yeah, you know, his team does a brand things, but you know he feels like.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

# 🔹 Updated Money-Making Focus

## 🔹 **NEW CRITICAL INFO**

**Zero Training Budget = Pure Opportunity:**
- Current training is brand product-focused only
- No process/sales training exists
- **Ask:** "What do poor sales cost you monthly vs what you'd pay to fix it?"

**In-Person Workshops = #1 Preference:**
- Mobile lessons #2
- This changes your delivery model pricing

## 🔹 **SAME CORE QUESTIONS (Still Money)**

1. **"What's your monthly recruitment cost?"** (Your pricing ceiling)
2. **"What would you pay for guaranteed 20% sales increase?"** (Value-based pricing)
3. **"Show me your worst store's numbers vs best store"** (ROI proof)

## 🔹 **NEW ANGLE TO PUSH**

**The Budget Gap:**
- "You spend £X on brand training but £0 on sales process - what if we proved that £Y spent on sales training would return £5Y in revenue?"

**Standardisation Insight:**
- Abu agreed industry needs it - this validates your regulator positioning
- People stuck at same level for 10 years with no progression framework

Core insight unchanged: 2-year bonds + hybrid evaluation + nudge system = your product. 🤖

Speaker 1 (100%)
How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys
here. Let me message him so many of these today like I feel like you two got tired.
I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when 
a customer is, like, pushing back, like, oh, for example, your prices are too expensive, 
yeah, what do you see? Because that's an objection to where you're sending. You say, Oh, this should have kind of like, oh, no, they're too expensive. Like, how do they? What do you say? You know, like, in that position, yeah, 
honestly, I would say all of them, like, yeah, hard to pick one or two. 
I would say, you 
know, definitely just customer engagement and service, okay, and then store operations and procedures, because I think with those two, you can't make anything work. So that's interesting. So like, giving them clear store 
processes that, yeah, 
just those out of interest now that you can do your 
benefit from, like, almost a playbook, 
like, just as it says associates, when you come in the morning, you look through, for example, like the customers expecting in the day. You engage your between 10 and 11, you engage your customers. I bought last three months, for example. You call them with like, and they almost like, obviously, it will change publication and by reality and whatnot. But almost like a, almost like a an hourly playbook of what associate would should do in terms of if we're looking at like the operations. Do you think that would benefit them? 
Yes, 100% because these all sound like simple things, but I can assure you, you know the instances where people aren't like paying attention to those things, and it's making, like, a huge, it's a huge disadvantage. So, yeah, I would say, like, even if it's just a simple, like, you know, that's the first module, or something like, Yeah, I do think it's something that makes, that would make a difference. 
I see, I'm just gonna say this here, so that obviously you can 
also track it for later. But based on this, there could be something around, like, a nudge that we do hourly, you know, like for we would have taken certain buttons to a certain level. We could then, like, prompt them, like with notifications or whatever. Like, you know, have you done this engage? Have you followed up with your customers today, you know, stuff like that. We can think around not just, kind of just direct customer, um, citizenship behaviour or FTR you're 
talking about. 
Hello, hello, 
hi, wait. Can you guys hear me? Yeah? Yeah. I 
I think, I think FC is having some 
issues. 
Um, all right, Abu, let's just go on and then is that, sorry? Repeat, repeat. Wait, 
no, wait. Can you guys 
hear me? Yeah, yeah, okay, 
okay, it 
cut out. 
No problem. No worries, man. 
I was just saying for later, I was just like bookmarking something with you. I was just saying for later we should just look at how we can because Abu mentioned one of the key things that will benefit. The team will be like training on next door operations. And then we spoke about maybe, oh right, yes, yes, yes, the notification. So 
yeah, 
notifications, prompt, yeah, to nudge, 
action, 
yes, exactly 
like a morning routine, but it's a shortfall routine. Yeah, exactly. So then 
notification by noon to say it's now noon. 
Have you done? 
Okay? So I'm 
the assumption I'm making here, then is that salespeople are allowed to have their phones on shop floor. 
You do have 
CDTs. Yeah, location, yeah. So, 
yeah, different business. But, I 
mean, the store at least, like, like, in smart mouth, like, Abu said, like, the store has his phone, right? 
But obviously with the but I put the salespeople also have their phones with them, right? Like, the personal firms on the show, yeah, they do, 
yeah. So if they got a prompt on the phone, 
like, yeah, okay, okay, okay, we can look at that. Ft later, 
I'm gonna skip this customization question for kind of spoke on it. 
But Abu just again on this standardisation thing, again, I'm bringing up just because, you know, we touched on it earlier, about how it will benefit the industry, and then you spoken about, you know, from a business perspective. But do you actually think, you know that standardisation overall would be useful, you know, to the industry? 
I know, like now, when looking at we're now looking at it not just for your like, your business, which makes sense, but like as a player in the industry, if everybody's held a certain standard and benchmark, does that ultimately help and plug some kind of gap that we're experiencing? 
Yeah, for sure. You know for sure. I 
think one thing I would say is that you have an organisation like smartwatch, you see some people who have spent, like, I'll just use the sake of store manager for an example, you know, they've spent like, 10 years in a row, you know, 
and like, it's just kind of like, there's no 
insight as to what they've picked up, or, you know, what is lacking, or what's the reason why they haven't progressed more than what they are? So, yeah, I think it's definitely important, absolutely, 
absolutely. 
I'm just gonna go to other questions I feel would 
be really important for you. One thing is, you know, obviously we're looking at how we can delivery, deliver, sorry, this, this trainings, and then we're a few options on the screen, from one to four, which would like you to rank one being sort of the most useful, most relevant channel for being the least relevant for the team. So we could just run from one to four if you thought, like if you think show mobile lessons would be great. If you think in person workshops are great as well, or written guides and voice coaching on WhatsApp. Yes, I think one 
in person workshop shops, two short, mobile lessons, 
three voice coaching, and the last written guide. 
Okay, perfect, and I am okay. That's 
great. Okay, cool, um, 
and then what would motivate you? Quickly? Yeah, 
oh, okay, cool. I think there's a lag on so yeah, I can, I can hear Abu 
when you say voice, the voice training in your mind. What does voice training look like? 
Like if I, if you, someone told you, oh, we bought one thing, and it's been implemented tomorrow. What? What would you think you would see? 
Um, you know, short voice notes, like, not more than, like, a minute, 30 seconds long, yeah, and 
not too intricate. So it's not like it's teaching you certain things, you know. It's just like maybe reminders or prompts, or you understand and explaining the importance of all those things. So, you know, I would say more, more it's like a guide than anything. You know, that's kind of why I sort of put that three as three. Yeah. Okay, cool, and thank you. 
Cool. Um, 
I think we've spoken on this motivation already, so my skip that. Uh, one thing to ask Abu, not necessarily to get the ball back on the corner, but do you have an annual training budget that you work. 
No, we 
don't really know you. 
Okay, so the trainings that you guys 
do are they stop us 
through what you currently do so that 
we can also how we can plug in or optimise that process of what we're trying to, you know, so it's more 
brand, 
brand focus. So our partners, they give us, give us stuff like trainings on more the product than the processes. And, yeah, so it's very product focused, either they when, when we get new collections, New Seasons, you know, they want to train to explain to the staff what this products are all about. So, yeah, it's more, more brand driven from a global perspective. And it's not really market 
yet. Yeah, yeah. 
I think that's, that's good feedback, because one of the guys who interviewed earlier was also saying, Yeah, you know, his team does other brand things, but, you know, he feels like they might, they were tied to just brand. Brand training is about i From my understanding, which I think also like what you've explained as well, I also assumed that brand training is a more product knowledge forecast and like based on the peculiarities of the brand, but not just generic sales upskilling, which is kind of over. 
And then, how would you there's a question that is here. I'm just gonna try and find it actually. I'll ask it now, but I'll skip it later, and just because we've spoken about, okay, this is it. How do, how do you currently ensure that this brand training, for example, that you do is actually translating on the shop floor, like do you currently do, tests, exams, look at any specific KPIs, anything like that. How Jackie ensure that the trainings are being done? Impacting the team. 
Honestly, it's, there's no real, like, there's no real way we track the training and how it translates to sales. You just look at the sales and you know, if there's a issue and in sales, it's just always a people problem. So like, Oh, do you have the right people, as though, if not, then you understand. So it's very, it's not very like, focused on the training side of things. So just Just quickly, Abu on what you're 
saying. I just want to, like, propose, like a question. So if, if you spent, like a random figure on training, but zero, okay, let's say you spent 20 M on brand training, and then you spent zero m on sales process. If we, if we or an organisation, was able to prove that a certain spend on sales training would return like an amount in revenue would, do you think that would encourage budget to go towards sales training? 
Yeah, of course, of course, 
of course, it would, of course. Okay, yeah, I think. And yeah, one, so, one one other 
number for I don't know if you know this, but do you know? I don't know if you could do it monthly or quarterly or but do you know how or how much you allocate for recruitment? 
Again, it's not. There's nothing scientific that we're doing per se in terms of an ad hoc process. 
So the reason why I'm asking is because 
we essentially, I'm trying to figure 
out, for example, if, from a business standpoint, if someone was either, like, you are hiring a pre certified person, or if you had to pick between hiring a pre certified person or having your existing self team behaviour or performance improved, let's say for the same cost, right? You spend money hiring three new people, or you get a system implemented that tracks and improves three members of your staff, which? Which would you pick? 
I was probably say members of of my staff, 
right, okay, and 
then just upskilling them spending the same number? Am I on bunny upskilling them as recruiting? 
Yeah. Do you think you're on? Do you think you're on? You? 
Do you think you're in the majority of minority for that opinion, in your position, I think minority. Probably I would. I would 
actually say minority, because I didn't know. 
Yeah, yeah, 
Okay, thank you. 
Yeah, no. Okay. 
Okay, so we're 
going towards the end, you know, many questions left. 
Just the next question, really. Hi.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

# 🔹 **BREAKTHROUGH INTELLIGENCE**

## 🔹 **ROI Validation Confirmed**
**Abu:** "If you could prove ROI on sales training, of course we'd allocate budget"
- Zero current measurement of training effectiveness
- Bad sales = "people problem" (not training problem)
- **Your opportunity:** Be the first to prove measurable sales training ROI

## 🔹 **Business Model Winner**
**Existing Staff > New Hires:**
- Abu prefers upskilling 3 existing vs hiring 3 new (same cost)
- **He thinks he's MINORITY** = most retailers prefer hiring over training
- **Exploit:** Target the majority who want pre-certified hires + the minority who want upskilling

## 🔹 **Pricing Strategy Gold**
**No Scientific Recruitment Spend:**
- No formal recruitment budget tracking
- Ad hoc hiring process
- **Ask:** "What did your last 3 hires cost including time, agency fees, onboarding?"

## 🔹 **Product-Market Fit**
**Zero Training Measurement:**
- Brand training exists but no performance tracking
- **Your edge:** Built-in ROI measurement from day one
- Sell the measurement system as much as the training

**Critical Next Questions:**
1. **"What's your worst-performing store's monthly revenue vs best?"** (ROI calculation base)
2. **"How many staff leave per year and what does replacement cost?"** (Retention value)
3. **"Would you pilot with one store if we guaranteed 20% sales increase?"** (Testing commitment)

The minority/majority insight = two product lines: upskilling service + pre-certified recruitment. 🤖

Speaker 1 (100%)
How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys
here. Let me message him so many of these today like I feel like you two got tired.
I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when 
a customer is, like, pushing back, like, oh, for example, your prices are too expensive, 
yeah, what do you see? Because that's an objection to where you're sending. You say, Oh, this should have kind of like, oh, no, they're too expensive. Like, how do they? What do you say? You know, like, in that position, yeah, 
honestly, I would say all of them, like, yeah, hard to pick one or two. 
I would say, you 
know, definitely just customer engagement and service, okay, and then store operations and procedures, because I think with those two, you can't make anything work. So that's interesting. So like, giving them clear store 
processes that, yeah, 
just those out of interest now that you can do your 
benefit from, like, almost a playbook, 
like, just as it says associates, when you come in the morning, you look through, for example, like the customers expecting in the day. You engage your between 10 and 11, you engage your customers. I bought last three months, for example. You call them with like, and they almost like, obviously, it will change publication and by reality and whatnot. But almost like a, almost like a an hourly playbook of what associate would should do in terms of if we're looking at like the operations. Do you think that would benefit them? 
Yes, 100% because these all sound like simple things, but I can assure you, you know the instances where people aren't like paying attention to those things, and it's making, like, a huge, it's a huge disadvantage. So, yeah, I would say, like, even if it's just a simple, like, you know, that's the first module, or something like, Yeah, I do think it's something that makes, that would make a difference. 
I see, I'm just gonna say this here, so that obviously you can 
also track it for later. But based on this, there could be something around, like, a nudge that we do hourly, you know, like for we would have taken certain buttons to a certain level. We could then, like, prompt them, like with notifications or whatever. Like, you know, have you done this engage? Have you followed up with your customers today, you know, stuff like that. We can think around not just, kind of just direct customer, um, citizenship behaviour or FTR you're 
talking about. 
Hello, hello, 
hi, wait. Can you guys hear me? Yeah? Yeah. I 
I think, I think FC is having some 
issues. 
Um, all right, Abu, let's just go on and then is that, sorry? Repeat, repeat. Wait, 
no, wait. Can you guys 
hear me? Yeah, yeah, okay, 
okay, it 
cut out. 
No problem. No worries, man. 
I was just saying for later, I was just like bookmarking something with you. I was just saying for later we should just look at how we can because Abu mentioned one of the key things that will benefit. The team will be like training on next door operations. And then we spoke about maybe, oh right, yes, yes, yes, the notification. So 
yeah, 
notifications, prompt, yeah, to nudge, 
action, 
yes, exactly 
like a morning routine, but it's a shortfall routine. Yeah, exactly. So then 
notification by noon to say it's now noon. 
Have you done? 
Okay? So I'm 
the assumption I'm making here, then is that salespeople are allowed to have their phones on shop floor. 
You do have 
CDTs. Yeah, location, yeah. So, 
yeah, different business. But, I 
mean, the store at least, like, like, in smart mouth, like, Abu said, like, the store has his phone, right? 
But obviously with the but I put the salespeople also have their phones with them, right? Like, the personal firms on the show, yeah, they do, 
yeah. So if they got a prompt on the phone, 
like, yeah, okay, okay, okay, we can look at that. Ft later, 
I'm gonna skip this customization question for kind of spoke on it. 
But Abu just again on this standardisation thing, again, I'm bringing up just because, you know, we touched on it earlier, about how it will benefit the industry, and then you spoken about, you know, from a business perspective. But do you actually think, you know that standardisation overall would be useful, you know, to the industry? 
I know, like now, when looking at we're now looking at it not just for your like, your business, which makes sense, but like as a player in the industry, if everybody's held a certain standard and benchmark, does that ultimately help and plug some kind of gap that we're experiencing? 
Yeah, for sure. You know for sure. I 
think one thing I would say is that you have an organisation like smartwatch, you see some people who have spent, like, I'll just use the sake of store manager for an example, you know, they've spent like, 10 years in a row, you know, 
and like, it's just kind of like, there's no 
insight as to what they've picked up, or, you know, what is lacking, or what's the reason why they haven't progressed more than what they are? So, yeah, I think it's definitely important, absolutely, 
absolutely. 
I'm just gonna go to other questions I feel would 
be really important for you. One thing is, you know, obviously we're looking at how we can delivery, deliver, sorry, this, this trainings, and then we're a few options on the screen, from one to four, which would like you to rank one being sort of the most useful, most relevant channel for being the least relevant for the team. So we could just run from one to four if you thought, like if you think show mobile lessons would be great. If you think in person workshops are great as well, or written guides and voice coaching on WhatsApp. Yes, I think one 
in person workshop shops, two short, mobile lessons, 
three voice coaching, and the last written guide. 
Okay, perfect, and I am okay. That's 
great. Okay, cool, um, 
and then what would motivate you? Quickly? Yeah, 
oh, okay, cool. I think there's a lag on so yeah, I can, I can hear Abu 
when you say voice, the voice training in your mind. What does voice training look like? 
Like if I, if you, someone told you, oh, we bought one thing, and it's been implemented tomorrow. What? What would you think you would see? 
Um, you know, short voice notes, like, not more than, like, a minute, 30 seconds long, yeah, and 
not too intricate. So it's not like it's teaching you certain things, you know. It's just like maybe reminders or prompts, or you understand and explaining the importance of all those things. So, you know, I would say more, more it's like a guide than anything. You know, that's kind of why I sort of put that three as three. Yeah. Okay, cool, and thank you. 
Cool. Um, 
I think we've spoken on this motivation already, so my skip that. Uh, one thing to ask Abu, not necessarily to get the ball back on the corner, but do you have an annual training budget that you work. 
No, we 
don't really know you. 
Okay, so the trainings that you guys 
do are they stop us 
through what you currently do so that 
we can also how we can plug in or optimise that process of what we're trying to, you know, so it's more 
brand, 
brand focus. So our partners, they give us, give us stuff like trainings on more the product than the processes. And, yeah, so it's very product focused, either they when, when we get new collections, New Seasons, you know, they want to train to explain to the staff what this products are all about. So, yeah, it's more, more brand driven from a global perspective. And it's not really market 
yet. Yeah, yeah. 
I think that's, that's good feedback, because one of the guys who interviewed earlier was also saying, Yeah, you know, his team does other brand things, but, you know, he feels like they might, they were tied to just brand. Brand training is about i From my understanding, which I think also like what you've explained as well, I also assumed that brand training is a more product knowledge forecast and like based on the peculiarities of the brand, but not just generic sales upskilling, which is kind of over. 
And then, how would you there's a question that is here. I'm just gonna try and find it actually. I'll ask it now, but I'll skip it later, and just because we've spoken about, okay, this is it. How do, how do you currently ensure that this brand training, for example, that you do is actually translating on the shop floor, like do you currently do, tests, exams, look at any specific KPIs, anything like that. How Jackie ensure that the trainings are being done? Impacting the team. 
Honestly, it's, there's no real, like, there's no real way we track the training and how it translates to sales. You just look at the sales and you know, if there's a issue and in sales, it's just always a people problem. So like, Oh, do you have the right people, as though, if not, then you understand. So it's very, it's not very like, focused on the training side of things. So just Just quickly, Abu on what you're 
saying. I just want to, like, propose, like a question. So if, if you spent, like a random figure on training, but zero, okay, let's say you spent 20 M on brand training, and then you spent zero m on sales process. If we, if we or an organisation, was able to prove that a certain spend on sales training would return like an amount in revenue would, do you think that would encourage budget to go towards sales training? 
Yeah, of course, of course, 
of course, it would, of course. Okay, yeah, I think. And yeah, one, so, one one other 
number for I don't know if you know this, but do you know? I don't know if you could do it monthly or quarterly or but do you know how or how much you allocate for recruitment? 
Again, it's not. There's nothing scientific that we're doing per se in terms of an ad hoc process. 
So the reason why I'm asking is because 
we essentially, I'm trying to figure 
out, for example, if, from a business standpoint, if someone was either, like, you are hiring a pre certified person, or if you had to pick between hiring a pre certified person or having your existing self team behaviour or performance improved, let's say for the same cost, right? You spend money hiring three new people, or you get a system implemented that tracks and improves three members of your staff, which? Which would you pick? 
I was probably say members of of my staff, 
right, okay, and 
then just upskilling them spending the same number? Am I on bunny upskilling them as recruiting? 
Yeah. Do you think you're on? Do you think you're on? You? 
Do you think you're in the majority of minority for that opinion, in your position, I think minority. Probably I would. I would 
actually say minority, because I didn't know. 
Yeah, yeah, right. And more 
people. 
Okay, thank you. Yeah, no, okay, 
okay. Abu, so we're going 
towards the end, how many questions left? 
The next question really, actually, I think we skipped by industry exam ones, which is good to do success metrics. So, I mean to small mark, 
there's obviously a few metrics on here that we look at like, I suppose, for any business that we look at like, you know, for to get the health of the business, but particularly post training. 
What metrics would you be looking at to ensure like, the training has impacted the business? Would you just be like revenue, or some of these other things that you would be looking at to see, you know, as a result of the impact of the training on the business? 
So I'd say basket 
size is one conversion rate, very much. So, um, very much, though, and maybe average sale value, okay, yeah, average over here, so, okay, 
customer satisfaction scores, so I can't speak into that. Okay, 
okay, yeah, um, but two, two follow up questions quickly. One, on conversion rate, obviously, as a percentage of traffic. Do you have an objective way of gauging traffic into the stores as well, or is it just like what the team reports? No, so we have started counting for traffic 
in our stores. Now we jump, but it's a very rudimentary process. We just use, you know, those Muslim Yeah, those tallies, 
yeah, yeah. So use 
that. And then they, they recorded daily, on a daily basis. 
So, and then we kind of that, does that right? Like it says associate, 
yeah, it is, yeah. 
So, 
it's not foolproof, at least it gives a fairly decent idea of, like, the track, yeah, okay, yeah, 
okay, I had that. And then 
the the second thing was, Oh, God, you said it. He said to me, I was gonna ask you a question on he said, conversion rate, 
oh, and customer satisfaction score. So you mentioned that you don't do CSAT, but if we were able to as part of the training as well, because also that also like businesses that in your position that don't really do CSAT, but, like, if we said, okay, you know what, as a result of this training, we're going to put QR codes in your windows, and we're going to have to work with you on a way to get, you know, your HR teams or whatever, to force, or, you know, ensure that the stores are getting customised to scan these codes and you and, you know, kind of give feedback would that be something that you'd be open to doing as well so that it also adds that extra level of of appraisal for you guys. Yeah, 
makes sense. It makes sense, it doesn't. 
I think, okay, cool. I think we just jumped.

Speaker 1 (100%)
How you doing? I'm good, bro. I'm sorry I was like my mic first. I just take my few minutes to get it back up running. Sorry,
Norris. Norris is ft on, on the go as well. Um, no, he's not take guys
here. Let me message him so many of these today like I feel like you two got tired.
I guess you, I know,
you
all right, bro, I've messaged him.
Let's hope that he joins the call before we we round up. But if you don't mind, man, I'm there. I'm just gonna get started. Just
yeah, we just like,
I'll share my screen, and then I'll basically give you a background of what we're trying to do. So obviously. So first of all, base my screen, yeah, I can, all right, cool.
So the way it will go, I'll just, like, kind of just read out the
questions, and then you just answer basically. But about it's 33 but to be honest, I kind of, like, merge questions. So you probably wouldn't, we probably wouldn't do all of that, and
usually it would take about half an hour to 40 minutes just to give you a background of what we're trying to do, so that it helps you the context of, like, how to frame the questions in terms of what we're trying to do. So obviously, you know, like I spoke to you about we're trying to do this. We're trying to develop this training for retail, retail in itself, in terms of back end roles eventually, but right now, it's more the front facing the sales teams that we're trying to train. And what we're trying to do is make the trainings more modular, so in a way that they can happen on site, in different stores at any point in time. And to do that, they need to be managed, manager LED. So the managers would be the ones to essentially do, let's call it a first level of assessment of the teams before we then do like a second level of assessment, which would be like, twice a year, result examination, you know, that we would essentially moderate to make sure, like, you know, to also gauge what the managers have done, and also just Make sure, like people are progressing as they should, but obviously by putting some kind of power in the hands of the managers, and also a part of it that we
hope that the managers themselves need to be equipped to a certain level and objective to a certain level, because then that can make up More what's going on in their business? If the managers are biassed and they're not objective, but they don't even know how to grade, and they're just like, Yeah, this person is great. This person is great. But then come the exam in six months time, they're not at a good level, and then the store does bad, and business was bad as a result. Like, you know, it reflects value on the on the manager. So that's really what we're trying to do. So really what we're doing with this interview is speaking to like the owners, managers, you know, and just kind of getting an idea of what you would want to see from a training like this, so that we're actually building a tool that works for the environment.
Yeah, got you got you bro, oh yeah,
Monday and
Salah and all the other things.
Thank you, bro.
I think, yeah, obviously Tim is already said the majority of other things. I think one from from the interviews that we've done so far,
I feel, I feel like some of the some of the questions that we have been when we jump into it, you'll you'll see what I mean. We have some multiple choice questions, and we have some open ended questions, but generally speaking, the way that the better interviews have gone is that we've tried to get through the questions in a way that obviously because we've asked the question now. So even if it seems like we're jumping around, it's because we're trying to drill down into a certain thing based on this conversation.
But feel free to, like, elaborate, like, there's no set format. Like, don't feel like, if there's something that comes to you that you think would be useful, even if you don't think it's directly related to the question, but because you understand the overarching reason why we're doing this, feel free to share.
All right. Make sense? All right. Cool.
So first question, Abu, what are the most common skill gaps you observe in your frontline retail staff today.
Okay, yeah, just as brief as I
can summarise it, yeah, you know, so it literally just seems like there's a lack of structure in the way a lot of our staff and a lot of retail staff in general go about making their sales. So, you know, my dad is, he's explained it to me before. I've never really had that kind of retail background or understanding of how a proper salesperson is supposed to, you know, approach customers.
I know that it's supposed to be essentially like a script, you know, where you like, have a way you approach them, and then, you know, even, like, making them feel the item, and, you know, selling intricate parts of the product to them. You know, there's no, there's no real structure in the way they go about things. And as a result, that leads to, like, a lack of confidence, because, you know, they think to themselves, or, how do we even approach this person that's not on our level kind of thing? Or, you know? So I just think that the lack of structure, it's, it's quite detrimental in the way they and leads to a lot of lost sales, you know, just because there's no, there's kind of a shotgun way of approaching things. So I think that's what I would say, is one common school guy
I see, fair enough. So, like, they know, they
know, logical man, like they know, looking out like what the customer wants, and then following up, like product knowledge. I get, like, about, like, the best attributes of the product they just like, basically selling in an unstructured manner, in terms of customer comes in, and then they just say, Okay, what do you want? Okay, this is the price seller. And go, there's no real Is that what you mean? Is that how you mean? No Exactly,
exactly, like the whole process from
like opening to upselling, closing, following up, they're not really following that flow Exactly, exactly. I do know that surge.
Just to elaborate a bit more, I do know that, like, you know, each retailer or each product has a different selling point, but I think even if you break it down into categories that, oh, this is the way you approach, like maybe even, um, segmenting it like formal clothes, like, you know, this is how you sell, or maybe footwear, you know, this is how you sell. And then versus apparel, I just think there should be a way of structuring, you know, how they, they approach things. So I think ft was designed as well. Oh, good, sorry,
because I'm sharing my
screen. Yeah, actually, going, yeah. I just, I guess I wanted a bit of an elaboration on shotgun, but I feel like you, you kind of said it already. Um, yeah, one, one question. Then obviously, it seems you're, you're quite aware of the problems.
Could, could you just give me an example of, like, the opposite of shotgun in your mind, like, what would it look like to do the opposite of the unit? Isn't good,
yeah. So I think, Okay, the first thing when the customer comes in, you walk, you welcome them in a way that obviously it seems genuine, and it seems like it's, you know, but it's something that's practised, you know. So they, they've, you kind of have a rapport with them, you know, off the bat, and then once you you welcome them in, you understand their needs, you know. So you're not selling them stuff that maybe they may not even care about or be interested in, and use them completely. But you know, you're building that rapper up, you understand their needs. And then, you know, you kind of, you know, so again, back to my point. I'm more like a retail expert, per se, but you know, it's, I think it's a way of just because I can imagine myself going into one of these stores and then somebody who I don't perceive on my level, like, I'm not, I'm a humble person. I like, I know you don't self proclaim those things, but, you know, I would like an approach where I can feel like this person may understand me. And, you know, can,
because most of the time you just walk,
I see customers just walking into the stores, and they don't even send the like sales associates or, you know, they are very cool to them, and then it's kind of, what's the point of having them in
the store? And, you know, so, yeah,
good points, man.
Um, so, I mean, I guess you've already covered it in terms of, like, what you want them to what you would want to see more consistently from what it sounds like, it's just like a more structured flow of selling and approaching,
like every transaction from what I'm hearing, right? Yeah, yeah. So just, but I
would say just for that question, too, you know, for behaviours, if I do circle behaviours, I'd say positivity. You know, positivity is really, really key, from what I've seen, because we even, we have these sales associates that they don't have the structure, but because they're positive, they kind of spread by those are the better performing ones, you know, but you see some negative guys that aren't even interested in the thing, you know, it's really bad for on a customer facing in a customer facing role, you need to be positive, I would say. So that's just the only thing I would add, yeah,
actually. I mean, yeah. I mean, just time
to be fair. I mean, I've seen one of the interviews we had yesterday, this kind of came out as well.
Like stuff like
you said a lot, you said came up. Yes, I
said in one of the interviews we had yesterday, just where Abu is talking about positivity, I think enthusiasm came up as well.
So yeah, I wasn't sure to say, but yeah, Abu, there's a bunch of things that you're saying that yeah, they're they're aligned with the things that we've been hearing as well. Like, for example, someone earlier today was saying that when it comes to buying their product, they they need the person that comes to sell them to feel like they understand the person's problem and that they are speaking to an expert. And not so much a like, yes, sir, three bags full, sir, but more like an equal, which is what I feel like you're right, instead of them getting the cold shoulders, like, Can I help you anything? Even if they're saying, No, I'm okay, you don't do it in such a dismissive way, which then affects the positivity, I guess, of the people who don't have as much as others, 100% Exactly. Yeah, yeah.
All right. So Abu. I mean, one of the things,
one of the things we're trying to do naturally with this training is like we are essentially trying to act like the regulator. And I think I explained this to you one of the positions we had where it's almost like we have a standardised thing where, for example, a store manager needs a level eight certification to be a store manager in any of the, you know, retail businesses that we are supporting, and so that that skill and that certificate is transferable.
And, you know, an assistant needs a level six, four, for example, an entry level is a level two or whatever certification. That way it helps, you know, vet the quality of people you are hiring. And, you know, it's kind of creates a good benchmark in the industry. Do you think this is something, one that would, that would interest you as a business like that you would get behind. And two, if, if someone had this
certification, would it make the person appear like a
more exciting candidate?
Okay, so like to answer question two. First, I would say yes, 100% that that would very much make a difference in how we look at these kinds of candidates, if they have a certification that, you know, is across is industry standard, and, yeah, that is transmissible. I think that's very valuable. So I'll put that very high up. But back to your first question. You know, I think we're all because I know you guys very well, and you know, so to me, like you're my brother, I'll be very honest here in Oakland, because I know how this industry is, and you know, it's quite, it's very, it's getting very, more and more competitive, increasingly competitive, I would say that, you know, I would invest we into, into a system that kind of benefits me. So how I why? Obviously, this is business. You know, you don't want you training up staff to then just uproot and go to another organisation because they get a better compensation package and whatever.
But I think ways around that so, you know,
I if it's if we're able to make it like, you know, focused on our, on our, in our own, like field. I don't know if that makes sense or yeah, you mean like, so tell me
if I'm, if I'm on what you're saying, do you mean something along like a track? So one of the things that's come out of our interviews is that this, there's this confirmation that a lot of people fall into retail, and they don't, they see it as a job, and they don't see it as a career. So if it was that by doing this, they kind of saw that they had a bit more of a trajectory within your organisation, do you think that would increase retention, even if people do the training that upskill them to potentially leave?
You know, so your your point is very valid. I think a lot of these things are internal. And, you know, like you said, it could be a way of integrating HR more into like, what you're doing, or whether it's managers or, you know, so that you monitor the responses to the training, and then you from you, or you, you know, you,
what's the word you you give these, like staff who perform against the training, you know, rewards, so that they they feel, you know, like there's a future and then there's vision for them,
if that makes sense.
So okay, are you? Are you referring to,
like HR, or management providing some incentive for completing the training within the organisation?
Yeah, I think it's necessary. So, like, we don't lose the stuff.
But Okay, so with experience, okay, so that does that
mean that what you actually want is a certification system, but one that's internal, so it's not recognised outside of the organisation, but in the organisation, if you get this certification, this is your pay. You get this one, this is your pay, but it's not transferable, because that's, that's the issue you're saying, right?
Like, imagine Amazon. Obviously there might be a grading that isn't valid in Microsoft, but within Amazon, it matters. Like, it's still a pay grade and things that I can aspire to,
yeah, exactly, exactly, so that that's coming
from the angle of if I invest, you know.
But it's a double
edged sword, you know, and that's why I introduced it by you guys are like my so I don't want to sound as if I'm being selfish, but I would love to get
started, I recognised, you know, along
this certificate system, okay, maybe, like you said, it's an internal one, but it's, you know, something that I think companies would hire, hire based on, you know, it does
ask you, Like, slight side question based on what you've said, Imagine that there was a recruitment agency.
So instead of you your issue being that you're losing people, this is that there's a company that supplies people that have done said training.
So for example, let's say the training is proven. It's going to give you results. It costs money to do the test. You do the test, the company pays for it, and by paying for it, you have to do a two year contract, right? The kind of thing that happens in FDM, in like the UK would, would that be something that, from a business standpoint, would make more sense to you, to be honest, yes, because I think
after two years, then you can then do another training, whether it's a higher level to, you know, make that stuff boosted, like, in terms of their career, or, like, tie them down at least for that two years, and then what they want, they can do whatever they want afterwards. So I that does make sense. You know, that is like a compromise to what I did say earlier. So makes sense, yeah, so,
like, new entrance, right? Sorry, no, that's for, like, new recruits, right? Abu, so obviously, if you're hiring from this agency, okay, no, but I think that makes sense. It's a good perspective. I mean, ft, we'll just go back and look at because it could be some
new recruits. It could be a thing that you send your staff on the training programme, right? And they still sign up on that for two years. It could be a different band, no, no, of course. But that one is,
it's like, company specific, like, because there's bonds, right? It's like, if, if a company, say, for example, let's
just say on the call, right?
If Abu elected someone to go
to the UK to do a store manager training in Charles series stores like, let's say, enjoy mystery or whatever, for two months, that person has some sort of bond to ensure that they're going to recruit something, you're not going to come back and dip like in the
next round, yeah, it's gonna have to be like a bond where the
company feels like, okay, you know what? There's been a sufficient knowledge transfer from you into the business. So I think, yeah, as I said, we'll have to, yeah, we can look at the FT, maybe something, man, you can talk about just a fourth that
came to me. Yeah,
no, it's really a good new perspective. Thanks for that.
Um, so I mean, just moving on to the the next two, sort of, again, two questions, I'm kind of like merging. So you know how we said earlier, like the managers are the onus is on them to sort of train people, right, at least for most part, or evaluate, not, not train to evaluate people.
The idea is that they're evaluating and in monthly blocks, and we're doing a more structured one every six months. First question would be, you know, are you confident that the managers can evaluate people sufficiently, and also, so sort of on a one to 10, pretend being very confident. How confident are you? And then just on the back of that,
I'm assuming you're not a 10, if you're not a 10, or would be your concern that they wouldn't be able to fully evaluate?
Yeah? Yes, yeah. So I think I would say about half,
just because, you know, and that's even like, I would say about half, and you know, so where I would feel 50% or thereabouts, aren't able to so, you know, this business has been around for like forever, 27 years, or whatnot. And I think, you know, at the beginning stage, there was a very like focus. There's a lot of focus on, you know, the type of stuff that are going into our stores. So, you know, the exposure level, and even the people managing them, they're, of a sudden, like level of exposure, you know, the story at some point, all of that went kind of crashing down. But I still believe that there are people in the system who, you know, like yourself, who were trained by you, like as the brand managers and their store managers, you know, and they've been around for a while, so I'll say, like, about half, in that sense, you know they
they may know what
initially you were trying to do, and somewhere along the line, so that just got lost, lost, but I'll say about half, yeah, okay, first, and
for the for the other half, let's say that You don't feel very confident, and is it because they sort of lack the skills, or you feel like there's other things, like a personal bias, like, you know, there's no objective or, you know, or you also, is there a combination of some of these things?
No, I think, I believe it's like a
top level thing actually, you know. So it's like a culture of the company, which is set by like the higher management, you know. So if higher management have a certain like instruction that, okay, don't employ these people in your stores, you know, I think there'll be some level of control, because already some like level of delegation has been given to the brand managers who, like, you know that that? And so I would say it's a high level thing. So obviously, you know, it starts from the top and then goes down all the way to, like, from brand managers. So it's like a high level thing.
That's what I would say, more more than it's like the culture of the organisation, you know that kind of sets the tone. So, yeah, yeah, fair.
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.
So now, if we are looking at a situation where, from the way it sounds like 50% it was like you're 50% confident that at least like half of the stock managers can satisfactorily evaluate people, and it's another 50% that, you know, quite, you know, fully sold on.
But we have this training model that is like, you know, there has to be a strong buy in from the managers to deliver now 50% as an error rate is quite high, because I can significantly skew the results. So, I mean, this is not something that we hadn't thought of, and this is something that we, you know, we, we kind of foresaw and we thought around a potential work around which was almost having the manager led evaluation as well as alternatively, as well an objective led evaluation. And about objective led evaluation, we're looking at things that are like agnostic of the manager. So it could be like the associates
are doing. Abu doing a recording of themselves, for example, doing a role play and then sending us that video to somehow assess right? So then that way it takes out the managers in, in in the decision making process.
But that in itself has its own pros and cons.
What do you think would be the best way to evaluate now, based on everything we've spoken about, would you say it's about the hybrid, like, still use managers as well as these objective things, or just use only the objective tools, or use only managers? What would you think would work?
I'd say a combination of both, both method, okay, yeah,
just because I think, you know, like, it
does make sense to be more objective, and, you know, do the training, training a bit less,
but centralised. But I do think there needs to be that level of oversight, you know, in what's what's happening. So, yeah, I'll see a combination of ft recently again,
yeah, so I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be a little bit annoying here. I'm gonna do some numbers quickly with you. Abu, just to try and drill, um, an understanding on this point. We did it. We did it earlier, but I just just quickly. Could you tell me how this
is all ballpark figures. How many sales people do you have in total?
So I think I would say between 250, and 300
Okay, let's go. Okay. We'll go with 375, and then how many managers would you say? Yeah, we have nine,
nine or store managers.
Store managers, we have,
I say, about 6060, 6565
okay, boom, okay, so you, you roughly have, like, 4.2 sales people per manager,
yes, right, yeah, um, yeah. So if we say, okay, 4.2 so let's say four. You have four sales people per manager. If four people, um, let's say when they finish a module, they have to record a two minute video, right. And then there are five of those modules that's 40 minutes right per person.
And you said, and it was four people, so that's 160
bear with me.
And you
said you had how.
Okay, 100 and so on 60.
Yeah. Do you think your managers would be able to spare,
I say, three hours a um, a
month watching video submissions? Because that this question that we're asking you, right about manager led, or having, like, another third party, or something like I'm just trying to give you a number to the figure and to show you where it came from. So it came from the number of sales people you have, how long of a video they would be sitting about this training, and then, based on that, how much of a time commitment your managers each would have, based on the sales people you have. So because before, you were saying hybrid, but now, now that we have the number of them needing to dedicate two point, yeah, let's say three hours a month purely to just watching videos, right? Nothing like obviously, it's learning related. But in a salesperson's mind, we all know how they may view it, even if they're a manager, does your does your answer change?
Like, no, I
think I would still like be an advocate of hybrid, you know, but would you would it shift? So, for example, let's say
before you wanted to do of the three hours so of the don't say it was 100 hours right before you wanted to do 50 hours done internally and 50 hours done by experts. And then, now that you you know how much time it is per person that they would have to put aside, would you still do 50% internally and 50% externally?
Yeah, I would. I would. And,
you know, just quickly my my reason why is just to maintain that professionalism and reason why you're doing it, you know. So it can even be like a check by the external party, just to
make sure that you know what is happening is
making sense, you know, if that makes sense, and then the other 50% still handled by managers just to maintain that level of like seriousness and ensure that the organisation is doing the right things internally. So, yeah, I would still be advocate. Okay, so you 
would use external as something to offload the work, and you'd also use external as a sense check on what your managers internally are saying, Yes, exactly, exactly, right. Okay, 
interesting. Thank you. 
Yeah. Okay, 
cool. So yeah, I mean moving on. 
Um, Abu, just the next question would be beyond, like, the modules that you think would be very valuable to to include in the training. 
There's some options on the screen. Is there any one or two that particularly stick out to you? They think, you know, the Nigerian teams will benefit from 
honestly, I'll see all of them. But what is objection handling 
like? What is that the you know, when 
a customer is, like, pushing back, like, oh, for example, your prices are too expensive, 
yeah, what do you see? Because that's an objection to where you're sending. You say, Oh, this should have kind of like, oh, no, they're too expensive. Like, how do they? What do you say? You know, like, in that position, yeah, 
honestly, I would say all of them, like, yeah, hard to pick one or two. 
I would say, you 
know, definitely just customer engagement and service, okay, and then store operations and procedures, because I think with those two, you can't make anything work. So that's interesting. So like, giving them clear store 
processes that, yeah, 
just those out of interest now that you can do your 
benefit from, like, almost a playbook, 
like, just as it says associates, when you come in the morning, you look through, for example, like the customers expecting in the day. You engage your between 10 and 11, you engage your customers. I bought last three months, for example. You call them with like, and they almost like, obviously, it will change publication and by reality and whatnot. But almost like a, almost like a an hourly playbook of what associate would should do in terms of if we're looking at like the operations. Do you think that would benefit them? 
Yes, 100% because these all sound like simple things, but I can assure you, you know the instances where people aren't like paying attention to those things, and it's making, like, a huge, it's a huge disadvantage. So, yeah, I would say, like, even if it's just a simple, like, you know, that's the first module, or something like, Yeah, I do think it's something that makes, that would make a difference. 
I see, I'm just gonna say this here, so that obviously you can 
also track it for later. But based on this, there could be something around, like, a nudge that we do hourly, you know, like for we would have taken certain buttons to a certain level. We could then, like, prompt them, like with notifications or whatever. Like, you know, have you done this engage? Have you followed up with your customers today, you know, stuff like that. We can think around not just, kind of just direct customer, um, citizenship behaviour or FTR you're 
talking about. 
Hello, hello, 
hi, wait. Can you guys hear me? Yeah? Yeah. I 
I think, I think FC is having some 
issues. 
Um, all right, Abu, let's just go on and then is that, sorry? Repeat, repeat. Wait, 
no, wait. Can you guys 
hear me? Yeah, yeah, okay, 
okay, it 
cut out. 
No problem. No worries, man. 
I was just saying for later, I was just like bookmarking something with you. I was just saying for later we should just look at how we can because Abu mentioned one of the key things that will benefit. The team will be like training on next door operations. And then we spoke about maybe, oh right, yes, yes, yes, the notification. So 
yeah, 
notifications, prompt, yeah, to nudge, 
action, 
yes, exactly 
like a morning routine, but it's a shortfall routine. Yeah, exactly. So then 
notification by noon to say it's now noon. 
Have you done? 
Okay? So I'm 
the assumption I'm making here, then is that salespeople are allowed to have their phones on shop floor. 
You do have 
CDTs. Yeah, location, yeah. So, 
yeah, different business. But, I 
mean, the store at least, like, like, in smart mouth, like, Abu said, like, the store has his phone, right? 
But obviously with the but I put the salespeople also have their phones with them, right? Like, the personal firms on the show, yeah, they do, 
yeah. So if they got a prompt on the phone, 
like, yeah, okay, okay, okay, we can look at that. Ft later, 
I'm gonna skip this customization question for kind of spoke on it. 
But Abu just again on this standardisation thing, again, I'm bringing up just because, you know, we touched on it earlier, about how it will benefit the industry, and then you spoken about, you know, from a business perspective. But do you actually think, you know that standardisation overall would be useful, you know, to the industry? 
I know, like now, when looking at we're now looking at it not just for your like, your business, which makes sense, but like as a player in the industry, if everybody's held a certain standard and benchmark, does that ultimately help and plug some kind of gap that we're experiencing? 
Yeah, for sure. You know for sure. I 
think one thing I would say is that you have an organisation like smartwatch, you see some people who have spent, like, I'll just use the sake of store manager for an example, you know, they've spent like, 10 years in a row, you know, 
and like, it's just kind of like, there's no 
insight as to what they've picked up, or, you know, what is lacking, or what's the reason why they haven't progressed more than what they are? So, yeah, I think it's definitely important, absolutely, 
absolutely. 
I'm just gonna go to other questions I feel would 
be really important for you. One thing is, you know, obviously we're looking at how we can delivery, deliver, sorry, this, this trainings, and then we're a few options on the screen, from one to four, which would like you to rank one being sort of the most useful, most relevant channel for being the least relevant for the team. So we could just run from one to four if you thought, like if you think show mobile lessons would be great. If you think in person workshops are great as well, or written guides and voice coaching on WhatsApp. Yes, I think one 
in person workshop shops, two short, mobile lessons, 
three voice coaching, and the last written guide. 
Okay, perfect, and I am okay. That's 
great. Okay, cool, um, 
and then what would motivate you? Quickly? Yeah, 
oh, okay, cool. I think there's a lag on so yeah, I can, I can hear Abu 
when you say voice, the voice training in your mind. What does voice training look like? 
Like if I, if you, someone told you, oh, we bought one thing, and it's been implemented tomorrow. What? What would you think you would see? 
Um, you know, short voice notes, like, not more than, like, a minute, 30 seconds long, yeah, and 
not too intricate. So it's not like it's teaching you certain things, you know. It's just like maybe reminders or prompts, or you understand and explaining the importance of all those things. So, you know, I would say more, more it's like a guide than anything. You know, that's kind of why I sort of put that three as three. Yeah. Okay, cool, and thank you. 
Cool. Um, 
I think we've spoken on this motivation already, so my skip that. Uh, one thing to ask Abu, not necessarily to get the ball back on the corner, but do you have an annual training budget that you work. 
No, we 
don't really know you. 
Okay, so the trainings that you guys 
do are they stop us 
through what you currently do so that 
we can also how we can plug in or optimise that process of what we're trying to, you know, so it's more 
brand, 
brand focus. So our partners, they give us, give us stuff like trainings on more the product than the processes. And, yeah, so it's very product focused, either they when, when we get new collections, New Seasons, you know, they want to train to explain to the staff what this products are all about. So, yeah, it's more, more brand driven from a global perspective. And it's not really market 
yet. Yeah, yeah. 
I think that's, that's good feedback, because one of the guys who interviewed earlier was also saying, Yeah, you know, his team does other brand things, but, you know, he feels like they might, they were tied to just brand. Brand training is about i From my understanding, which I think also like what you've explained as well, I also assumed that brand training is a more product knowledge forecast and like based on the peculiarities of the brand, but not just generic sales upskilling, which is kind of over. 
And then, how would you there's a question that is here. I'm just gonna try and find it actually. I'll ask it now, but I'll skip it later, and just because we've spoken about, okay, this is it. How do, how do you currently ensure that this brand training, for example, that you do is actually translating on the shop floor, like do you currently do, tests, exams, look at any specific KPIs, anything like that. How Jackie ensure that the trainings are being done? Impacting the team. 
Honestly, it's, there's no real, like, there's no real way we track the training and how it translates to sales. You just look at the sales and you know, if there's a issue and in sales, it's just always a people problem. So like, Oh, do you have the right people, as though, if not, then you understand. So it's very, it's not very like, focused on the training side of things. So just Just quickly, Abu on what you're 
saying. I just want to, like, propose, like a question. So if, if you spent, like a random figure on training, but zero, okay, let's say you spent 20 M on brand training, and then you spent zero m on sales process. If we, if we or an organisation, was able to prove that a certain spend on sales training would return like an amount in revenue would, do you think that would encourage budget to go towards sales training? 
Yeah, of course, of course, 
of course, it would, of course. Okay, yeah, I think. And yeah, one, so, one one other 
number for I don't know if you know this, but do you know? I don't know if you could do it monthly or quarterly or but do you know how or how much you allocate for recruitment? 
Again, it's not. There's nothing scientific that we're doing per se in terms of an ad hoc process. 
So the reason why I'm asking is because 
we essentially, I'm trying to figure 
out, for example, if, from a business standpoint, if someone was either, like, you are hiring a pre certified person, or if you had to pick between hiring a pre certified person or having your existing self team behaviour or performance improved, let's say for the same cost, right? You spend money hiring three new people, or you get a system implemented that tracks and improves three members of your staff, which? Which would you pick? 
I was probably say members of of my staff, 
right, okay, and 
then just upskilling them spending the same number? Am I on bunny upskilling them as recruiting? 
Yeah. Do you think you're on? Do you think you're on? You? 
Do you think you're in the majority of minority for that opinion, in your position, I think minority. Probably I would. I would 
actually say minority, because I didn't know. 
Yeah, yeah, right. And more 
people. 
Okay, thank you. Yeah, no, okay, 
okay. Abu, so we're going 
towards the end, how many questions left? 
The next question really, actually, I think we skipped by industry exam ones, which is good to do success metrics. So, I mean to small mark, 
there's obviously a few metrics on here that we look at like, I suppose, for any business that we look at like, you know, for to get the health of the business, but particularly post training. 
What metrics would you be looking at to ensure like, the training has impacted the business? Would you just be like revenue, or some of these other things that you would be looking at to see, you know, as a result of the impact of the training on the business? 
So I'd say basket 
size is one conversion rate, very much. So, um, very much, though, and maybe average sale value, okay, yeah, average over here, so, okay, 
customer satisfaction scores, so I can't speak into that. Okay, 
okay, yeah, um, but two, two follow up questions quickly. One, on conversion rate, obviously, as a percentage of traffic. Do you have an objective way of gauging traffic into the stores as well, or is it just like what the team reports? No, so we have started counting for traffic 
in our stores. Now we jump, but it's a very rudimentary process. We just use, you know, those Muslim Yeah, those tallies, 
yeah, yeah. So use 
that. And then they, they recorded daily, on a daily basis. 
So, and then we kind of that, does that right? Like it says associate, 
yeah, it is, yeah. 
So, 
it's not foolproof, at least it gives a fairly decent idea of, like, the track, yeah, okay, yeah, 
okay, I had that. And then 
the the second thing was, Oh, God, you said it. He said to me, I was gonna ask you a question on he said, conversion rate, 
oh, and customer satisfaction score. So you mentioned that you don't do CSAT, but if we were able to as part of the training as well, because also that also like businesses that in your position that don't really do CSAT, but, like, if we said, okay, you know what, as a result of this training, we're going to put QR codes in your windows, and we're going to have to work with you on a way to get, you know, your HR teams or whatever, to force, or, you know, ensure that the stores are getting customised to scan these codes and you and, you know, kind of give feedback would that be something that you'd be open to doing as well so that it also adds that extra level of of appraisal for you guys. Yeah, 
makes sense. It makes sense, it doesn't. 
I think, okay, cool. I think we just jumped.
