One of the biggest hurdles in Nigeria is navigating the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), and environmental agencies. Airport engineering consultants in Nigeria simplify this process by preparing documentation, conducting assessments, and securing all required permits on behalf of the investor.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c0b39122-e3f8-4b66-9d20-ac5e005ea9a7","timestamp":"2026-02-13T09:54:00.489Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"c444deed-188e-4c50-9912-611e3113ec51"}

Formally registered in 1997, incorporated in 2007 with N25M share capital. Consortium structure with two partner firms: Cievam Engineering Nig. Ltd and Koshvo & Associates Nig. Ltd.\n\n**Credentials:**\n- COREN registered: EF.00206\n- ACEN member: F146\n\n**Claimed stats (from website):**\n- 60 completed projects\n- 121 clients\n- 50 procurement contracts\n- 13 award-winning projects\n\n**Services:** Electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil/structural engineering, infrastructural engineering, procurement, safety & security, home automation, consulting, general building services, maintenance.\n\n**Key quote from website:** \"Total solution approach to all areas of power delivery -- distribution, transmission, and generation interconnection needs.\"\n\n**Sectors served:** Banks, residential, housing estates, hotels, office complexes, airports, factories, workshops, religious buildings, educational, recreational, commercial, mixed-use, healthcare.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Projects (2024-2026)\n\n**No recent projects found in web search.** The company's website project gallery only shows three projects with photos and zero technical detail:\n\n1. **Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja** -- multiple phases\n2. **Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos**\n3. **Nigerian Content Development Project, Bayelsa**\n\nThe NAIA new international terminal (56,000 sqm, inaugurated 2023) was built by CCECC (China Civil Engineering Construction Company). IECL's role appears to have been MEP consulting/design -- confirmed by the fact that Deborah Maidawa (IECL employee) holds the title \"Resident Electrical Engineer at NAIA.\" This suggests IECL is/was the resident MEP consultant on-site for the airport, not just a design-phase firm.\n\n**No 2024-2026 project wins discoverable via web search.**\n\n---\n\n## Power/Generator Connection\n\n**HIGH relevance to Mikano's product line.**\n\nIECL explicitly positions itself as providing \"total solution approach to all areas of power delivery\" including generation. As an MEP consultancy, they:\n\n- Specify generator sets in tender documents (size, brand, type)\n- Design power distribution systems (HV/LV)\n- Design backup/standby power architecture\n- Handle fire detection, alarm systems, access control (per Deborah Maidawa's profile)\n\nDeborah Maidawa's LinkedIn confirms expertise in:\n- Major Power Distribution\n- Lighting\n- Internal Power receptacles\n- Fire Detection and Alarm Systems\n- VA/PA systems\n- Access Control Systems\n- Preparation of Electrical BEME (Bill of Engineering Measurement & Evaluation)\n- Technical specifications for tender purposes\n- Procurement audits (BBP standards)\n\n**This is the exact profile that writes genset specs into tender documents.** The firm designs the electrical systems that dictate which generators get purchased.\n\n---\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Source | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| Eng.

Airport MEP Refresh / New Phase Work\n- **Signal:** IECL has resident engineer at NAIA. Airports have ongoing maintenance + expansion cycles. New runway planned. Cargo expansion mentioned.\n- **Strength:** WARM\n- **Approach:** If new airport phase is tendered, IECL will likely bid for MEP consulting. They'd specify generators.\n- **Risk:** No evidence of current active tender.\n\n### 2. Bayelsa Content Development Expansion\n- **Signal:** Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has been expanding the Brass Island industrial zone and Bayelsa projects. IECL has done MEP work there.\n- **Strength:** WARM\n- **Approach:** If NCDMB has new phases, IECL is a known MEP consultant. Industrial projects = larger gensets.\n- **Risk:** One project doesn't mean ongoing relationship.\n\n### 3. Government/Institutional Projects (Jajere's Procurement Background)\n- **Signal:** Muhammed Jajere was Chief Procurement Officer at Bureau of Public Procurement (Presidency). This is a government procurement insider. Government projects (ministries, military, hospitals) always need genset specs.\n- **Strength:** WARM\n- **Approach:** Jajere's government network could pull IECL into federal project tenders where Mikano generators are specified.\n- **Risk:** Government procurement is slow and political. No LinkedIn page = hard to reach.\n\n### 4. Direct Genset Specification Influence\n- **Signal:** IECL writes BEME (Bill of Engineering Measurement & Evaluation) and technical specifications for tenders. Every project they consult on will include genset specifications. They position as \"total power delivery\" firm.\n- **Strength:** HOT (structural, not event-based)\n- **Approach:** Relationship with IECL's electrical engineers = Mikano gets specified in their tender documents. Deborah Maidawa is the entry point (LinkedIn-accessible, writes the actual specs).\n- **Risk:** Small firm = lower project volume than MAR&MOR or Megawatts.\n\n### 5. Hotel/Commercial Sector Growth (Abuja)\n- **Signal:** IECL does hotels, office complexes, banks. Abuja has ongoing commercial development. Their \"121 clients\" suggests breadth across sectors.\n- **Strength:** COLD\n- **Approach:** Generic -- no specific trigger, just sector presence.\n- **Risk:** No evidence of specific current hotel/commercial projects.\n\n---\n\n## Website Intel\n\n- **Design quality:** Basic/dated HTML. Not a firm that invests in marketing.\n- **Project gallery:** Photos only, zero technical writeups. Suggests the firm relies on relationships/reputation, not marketing.\n- **No team page with photos.** Board listed only on about.html with names + titles.\n- **Partner firms listed prominently** (Cievam, Koshvo) -- consortium model means they scale through partnerships, not headcount.\n- **No blog, no news, no case studies, no downloadable brochures.**\n- **No LinkedIn company page** (confirmed Feb 12 verification).\n- **No social media presence.**\n\n---\n\n## Prior Pipeline Assessment\n\n**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** IECL was previously evaluated on Feb 12, 2026 during LinkedIn verification of node target firms. Result: **SKIP -- no LinkedIn page, too small (1-10 employees).**\n\nThis research was conducted to validate whether trigger signals override the skip decision.\n\n---\n\n## Score\n\n- **Company relevance:** 8/10 -- MEP consultancy that writes genset specs. Perfect NODE archetype. Airport + industrial + commercial portfolio. \"Total power delivery\" positioning.\n- **Trigger strength:** 4/10 -- No active, specific triggers found. Airport work is historical (2023 terminal). No evidence of current project pipeline. Structural relevance (they will always spec gensets) but no time-sensitive signal.\n- **Node value:** 5/10 -- Small firm (1-10 people) limits throughput. No LinkedIn page limits reach. But quality is there: NAIA resident engineer, government procurement connections, ACEN/COREN credentials. Consortium model (Cievam + Koshvo) may extend reach beyond headcount.\n- **Overall priority: LOW-MEDIUM**\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Uphold the SKIP for active outreach.** The Feb 12 skip decision was correct:\n- No LinkedIn page = no scalable outreach channel\n- 1-10 employees = low project volume compared to MAR&MOR (157), Megawatts (20-49), CCP (51-200)\n- No discoverable recent projects = unclear if actively winning work\n\n**BUT: Keep Deborah Maidawa on radar.** She is LinkedIn-accessible, writes actual genset specs, and is resident at NAIA. If she moves to a larger firm or posts about a new project, that becomes a WARM trigger. Worth a LinkedIn connection request (low effort, option value).\n\n**Jajere's procurement background is interesting but unactionable.** No LinkedIn, no direct channel. Government procurement insider = potential future node if a channel opens.\n\n**Reclassify if:** IECL wins a visible new project (especially industrial/airport scale), or Deborah Maidawa posts about current work on LinkedIn.\n\n---\n\nSources (80/20):\n- 40% -- https://iecl-nigeria.com (about.html, project.html, services.html)\n- 25% -- ZoomInfo employee directory snippets (search results, not fetched)\n- 15% -- LinkedIn profiles (Deborah Maidawa, Adedeji Abiodun Emmanuel)\n- 10% -- /projects/.cache/agent-outputs/2026-02-12-linkedin-verification.md\n- 10% -- /projects/mikano/02-Diesel-First/Lead-Generation/contact-cache.json + pipeline.md\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1289,"cache_read_input_tokens":41774,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1289},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY5sFh7ZBATiv6ydB9iqz","type":"assistant","uuid":"a0e4489a-fad3-4af7-905d-2936fbb9dbd9","timestamp":"2026-02-13T09:56:50.112Z"}

Consortium model with two partner firms (Cievam Engineering, Koshvo & Associates). COREN + ACEN registered. They claim 60 projects and 121 clients.\n\n**Board discovered from their about page:**\n\n| Name | Title | Notes |\n|------|-------|-------|\n| Eng. Hassan K. Odediran | Managing Partner/CEO | No web footprint outside IECL site |\n| Eng. Muhammed B. Jajere | Partner | Ex-Chief Procurement Officer, Bureau of Public Procurement (Presidency). Government insider. |\n| Eng. Zubair Sadiq | Associate Partner | No additional web presence |\n| Mrs. Bose Odediran | Manager | Likely spouse of CEO |\n\n**Best contact found:** **Deborah Maidawa** -- Senior Electrical Engineer, Resident Electrical Engineer at NAIA airport. LinkedIn-accessible. Writes BEME docs, technical specs, procurement audits. She is the person who literally writes generator specifications into tender documents.\n\n**13 additional staff identified** via ZoomInfo search result snippets (engineers, M&E, mechanical, electrical roles).\n\n**Generator connection is structurally strong** -- they position as \"total power delivery\" and their electrical engineers write genset specs into every project they consult on. But the firm is small, has no LinkedIn page, no recent discoverable projects, and no active triggers.\n\n**Verdict: Uphold the Feb 12 SKIP decision for active outreach.** The structural relevance (8/10) is real, but the trigger strength (4/10) and node value (5/10) don't justify prioritizing over MAR&MOR, Megawatts, CCP, or the verified outreach-ready firms. **One exception:** Deborah Maidawa is worth a low-effort LinkedIn connection -- she's the spec writer, and if she moves firms or posts about a new project, that flips the trigger to WARM."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3056,"cache_read_input_tokens":43063,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3056},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY5sMHSwCPzHv7kdVqMTn","type":"assistant","uuid":"032cc700-f261-429d-84bb-6d470964a6fa","timestamp":"2026-02-13T09:57:02.511Z"}
