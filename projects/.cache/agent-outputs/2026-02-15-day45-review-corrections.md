## Raw Voice Review (Full Transcription)

Okay, so we have what you're looking at, which is the 45 day flywheel. This is a visual diagram of the full cycle with post marks as the missing. Seven friends, this is in this is rewind. We review it, tell me what's wrong, what's missing. What hits, what's laid, when you see it laid out. Okay, cool, so seeing the gradient change from less, like green to less intense between day 30 and 45, I feel like this is a compression time that we should have an agent that is reviewing this period of time so that as we leave now from day 45 to day 60, there's a compounding. So also the fact that we don't have this timeline annotated isn't gonna help. We should definitely have an expanded view as annotated so you can look at the history and review in the same way as you can. Say, it has to have a blend of both in sports and then also from, say, a management view. Again, this is very different towards management and self-management. Activity is sort of reading about it. The flywheel, I like, but I think where you have the blocks of text, like you are strong here, engineering as you form those process ship. It's good, but it can be bigger, both the text and the space. So build document content. I like the fact that you have to build document content and then you have to have some working in one color and posting red. That helps me see it fully. I think the squares, the square shapes of the squares and the things that are supposed to be in the squares is distracting. And this is why I say that ASCII art could be better and the arrow should actually join with the box. So it's a small improvement, maybe it's just CSS styling that still looks like ASCII. I basically want it to look like an easel board, but it's gonna be detailed. If you can do that, then we don't need to be using it again. Start with ASCII and then translate it. And then just translate a script that we have to edit instead of you thinking about it every time. I don't know what that type of thinking is, but that putting something so that it modulizes something that even if you're doing it sequentially. And then you can have some agent that knows about all of these and has them referenced in the index. I can look at if I need to in some database. And we can have sessions where we look at all of these random things and we're like, how can we improve this component? Again, because that'll be a maintenance part of the business if you're writing this type of business. [COUGH] Anyway, it's here to mine capture, process, human content, so the content part we'll build out. And we're gonna take references as well to build out the content. So there's a process of templatizing things to make content posts, which is missing things. That's why you do these things and it makes it one thing you want to post on the work. Yep, exactly. Coming back to those, seven threads, flywall architecture, I'm trying to trick mining. Self-draw games exactly, telegram, VPS pipeline, system, send, digest. I mean, I can get them however. The income is RSSV, I don't mind. It doesn't have to be on the VPS. I just feel like VPS is a big thing people talk about. I'm gonna try and use it, download a path to clipboard, what I'm asking is definitely, it's not to do with the telegram VPS. That is a specific separate thing. A forward content from existing group. That is a separate thing, the telegram group. The telegram of VPS are separate things, they're big input projects that shouldn't be grouped together like that. Proof of work, case studies. This is from VV, the Learning Resolves by Jack Butcher. It's about proof of work in sawdust. When you heard sawdust, you should have picked that up and been able to reference that. I'm not gonna raise the risk for it for this, all that you should see. Faces, content, you also have tied into EP learning, so I'm gonna wait for that before you go and say it. I'm not on camera, stream, recording, chat. ASCII plus music plus animation of the ASCII and movement of the ASCII is very easy to communicate this stuff. If you're animating in a very cheap way ASCII art, you can reduce the level of the model that you use. You can buy a really, really cheap video model. And in the same way that you've got a really, really cheap image generation by doing ASCII that's just slightly good or slightly better CSS. You have these screenshots and you have these start and finish. And now you can wireframe scenes that you can describe. There's another flow that I want to capture. I think that I'm raising, yeah, I think that I'm raising it the better way to see it, but I'm capturing it. Faces, content, factory, exactly, exponential time plus cost, bandwidth, 20x. Yeah, at the moment we have until, I mean, we're already at like 20% and we're gonna use it today so you can see that the team agents, like how efficiently we use them, how many are gonna be in what model and hat, and when we deploy them and what they are working on. We need that 20x to actually be a 20x for us. We don't wanna waste a 20x, that's what I'm trying to say. There's an investor handle here on the capacity of the engine that we're building. Yes, so this two times audio speed run is a test that I want to run. We don't wanna know if it actually does cost half the cost, we wanna see if it does. And pass and applies everywhere yet, that is a separate thing. But yes, this seven exponential time and cost is probably a research arm that as we are going through this should produce some people or roles that we want to keep. And as we distill things from those people, we will now get elements of the departments for that specific thing. Decision and principles. I like this decision and principles. Flywall, yeah, cheaper models for extraction, yeah, JSON first. Extraction is not just a JSON, it's an advanced JSON first extraction, where you can even break the thing up into pieces and then do JSON on those pieces. And that fractalness, I think, and that fractal also is fractalness, is it fractaless allowing you to save on price when you do the contact sheet? And how else can we apply that? Screen shot, capture, hotkey, watcher, mining, both daily and on demand, yeah, telegram is two way, yeah. You go for heavy processing, no matter what heavy processing, face of content, not on camera, yeah. And then we're thinking of stuff in like audio, because if you base it in audio, like the person who's got their eyes closed. And if it catches my attention, I clip that and find a good way to capture clips. And then there's going to be the stop and then I codify and heavy JSON them as like the images and the frames and the story and the hooks and the copy and the image and the content writing and the placement of things and the animations and the types of shots that I've done. And the way that the lighting is done and the way that the expressions are done and the inversion that are conveyed, all of these things that you would have as you break down a video to then be in JSON so that you can say I'm building this, what do we have? And then I can look for things in a more concentrated way, I can even have the AI look for things in a more concentrated way. And then the information we bring in because we have built things and we've got these agents from like this thing again where I said the sessions of agents that are able to have things that we just do and it builds the company. And then you can review those things and you can say like, who do you think hasn't been performing well or who do you think has been off in a lot of the conversation? You can see the conversation, you can review the person and just make improvement. [BLANK_AUDIO] Yep, then auto-base with censorship filter, yeah self-strawal games, you have bedtime between one and one per year, you curate for AI mind exactly. And why that decision made sense like that as an explanation, I think is a post or something to convey and has a post principle called orientation transferable parts and yeah, modular builds, so many folders at once exactly. So these are from proof of work, but any content is a function of doing work. Yeah, observability ASCII is what I've shown to you. We need to elaborate on the ASCII point. Observation, what I mean is that the way my, do you know what, I'll post, I'll put, let me share. I feel like there's an aestheticness to me seeing. [BLANK_AUDIO] It's the way that my current terminal set up, it's like this off-white blue color like paper, like old receipt paper. And then it's got the text in the code like way and I just find it easier to look at over the amount of time that I have to see. I think that can be, because I can have the ASCII art, I think I can do a post for example. If I did a thread and I was saying something, the first way I can get that idea out is that I can make the slides in ASCII and those slides can have the headers to the tweets, that's the type of thing that I said ASCII work, publish or content. And then you can make quotes for those things as well. You can refine them over time. Observation, yep, missing out, but yeah, aspiration, exponential time, yep. Race, sees, proof of work, highest pull, telegram, high pull. I think you need to adjust on what you're saying, the basis content. I mean, that's what we're doing, aren't we? Self-show games. I mean, these are the highest pull ones, but obviously, so this race sees you should look at, you should give me this straight away in context of work I'm looking at, cuz otherwise I'm taking this in, yes, this is great, but it's only the individual things that we're trying to compound, tension, strong building, shipping, group zero, work is not being done, poetry. Yeah, so not to rest, need the output versus system should work over time. So I can rest, building for self-control versus ship for clients, yeah. Spend on building capacity, this, or conserve, constantly talking about vision, yeah. This tension thing is very, very good. I like this, I wanna screen shoot this visual, cuz I like this visual. I like this way, this info, I think the versus could be better. So I see you can describe versus better. All right, I guess it's an A versus a B, and it's a left and a right. I think you can do that, and I can flick through them in this space, same window as opposed to reading one and two and three. And also in these tensions, is there a solution? If you suggest a solution that I can give you a richer, we can try and compress many things me reviewing into one. So that then if I leave, I just stop the transcription and I can come back and say, now the extraction quality. So fixed key needs fit, decisions, principles, aspirations, done above, add requires, column, to actions, flag unclear, voice entities. Okay, this is the extraction quality, recursive verify. This is something again that we like. This is the actual processing, this thing of processing the transcript. You see it's such a, there's many things to it. We haven't even looked at the, is this to do with the oil quality? Is this the oil one? Is that what this is? Priority rank, is this like how it ranks on the quality of the oil? I can see it, I'm talking nonsense, I can focus on the better things. Bedtime target, yeah, time of remaining, review this page. I mean, we're gonna pass it bedtime probably, but like not by loads. Maybe like two, it's gonna be Sunday after all. Review this page, give correction via voice, yes, exactly. And we're trying to build the thing for me to give these corrections via voice in a better way. I am very happy about if you look into some better voice tools on GitHub that I can use that how we can install them. Because the better we make that review a page and give correction via voice, we're off to the races. I'm doing pretty good first time. First, self made quote, understand the force anymore. Yeah. I think you have the, I will give review now, do you know what I mean? Find it. See, because I can see this thing as well. I know that if I get lost, I can come back and this review, I think the more time I'm spending at a review thing, the less time I'm gonna get confused, the more time I'm looking at text, the more time I'm having to come away from something and come back to looking at it high focus. And today this thing is all of starting without anything and then doing on paper. If I didn't want to talk or doing on voice and then that forming something and then I think there's a gap that I need to fill before I still pick up my laptop. Cuz my laptop's not clean, I need to, like my tabs and stuff, I need to be AI. And if I can have AI arranging and deleting my tab, that is gonna again make the productivity. Cuz we've said, why is my, we've said, I don't think it's just sleep. We've said that operator co, covenants is so good and exactly, because the capacity isn't the test, so shouldn't we build that capacity? Isn't that the biggest leverage area? I think it is. [BLANK_AUDIO] Okay, so I've added before anything. The, yeah, the puma pitch debrief. This is something that you wanna process and save somewhere and obviously it goes towards an issue that we're already running. First mind run on these dumps, test the skills tomorrow. Yeah, that needs to be a skill. I think you need to tell me if these things are, I need a label knowing that these things are in GitHub. And I need that label to be tested that it is in real time and it's not old and saying that things are safe that are not safe, it needs to not be made in a hard coded way. And that thing of what should be hard coded and what shouldn't be hard coded needs to be tested so that we're not looking at wrong information. There's a cleanliness piece that an agent to be running on a lot of these visual artifacts. Sunday 12 trades week review, yeah, triage rates, which have the highest score. I think this cap of five is gonna be a nice baseline to hit once we've processed things. We're not gonna make it five and then not look at like a thousand and pick the top five. It's the top one that meet the cream. It's not that you have a cap of five. Obviously I come up with like five in a conversation.

## Extracted Corrections (Structured)

### 1. Timeline Annotation (MISSING)
- The timeline is NOT annotated -- this needs to be expanded with annotations
- "The fact that we don't have this timeline annotated isn't gonna help"
- Need an expanded view that is annotated so you can look at history and review
- Should blend both sports and management/self-management views

### 2. Flywheel Sizing
- The flywheel concept is good ("I like")
- But the blocks of text ("you are strong here, engineering as you form those process ship") need to be BIGGER -- both text and space
- The gradient change from green to less intense between day 30-45 represents compression time
- Should have an agent reviewing this period so there's compounding as we move from day 45 to day 60

### 3. Build/Document/Content Flow
- Likes the build-document-content structure
- Likes having working in one color and posting in red -- "helps me see it fully"
- The square shapes and items inside squares are DISTRACTING
- ASCII art would be better than current styling

### 4. Easel Board Aesthetic (KEY DIRECTION)
- "I basically want it to look like an easel board, but it's gonna be detailed"
- CSS styling that still looks like ASCII
- Arrows should actually join with the box (currently disconnected)
- Start with ASCII then translate -- have a reusable script instead of rebuilding each time
- "If you can do that, then we don't need to be using it again"

### 5. Thread Corrections: Telegram != VPS
- **CRITICAL CORRECTION:** Telegram and VPS are SEPARATE things
- "The telegram and VPS are separate things, they're big input projects that shouldn't be grouped together like that"
- Forward content from existing group = Telegram thing (separate)
- VPS pipeline = separate infrastructure project

### 6. Proof of Work / Sawdust Reference
- "This is from VV, the Learning Resolves by Jack Butcher"
- "It's about proof of work in sawdust"
- "When you heard sawdust, you should have picked that up and been able to reference that"
- Correction: the system should have caught this reference automatically

### 7. Content Factory / Faces
- ASCII + music + animation of ASCII = cheap way to communicate
- Can reduce model cost by animating ASCII art cheaply
- Same principle as cheap image generation via slightly-better-CSS ASCII
- Screenshots provide start and finish states for wireframing scenes

### 8. Tensions Visual (LIKED)
- "This tension thing is very, very good. I like this"
- Wants to screenshot the visual
- The "versus" format could be improved -- A vs B as left and right
- Should be flickable in same space/same window (not reading 1, 2, 3 sequentially)
- **Each tension should suggest a solution** -- "If you suggest a solution I can give you a richer [response], we can try and compress many things"

### 9. Voice Review Tooling (META)
- "The better we make that review-a-page-and-give-correction-via-voice, we're off to the races"
- Wants investigation into better voice tools on GitHub
- The review loop (look at visual, give voice corrections) is the key workflow to optimize
- "I'm doing pretty good first time" -- first attempt at this review pattern

### 10. Extraction Quality / Processing
- Recursive verify is good -- "This is the actual processing, this thing of processing the transcript"
- Labels for what's in GitHub need to be tested in real time (not stale/hard-coded)
- "What should be hard coded and what shouldn't be hard coded needs to be tested"
- Cleanliness piece: an agent should be running on visual artifacts

### 11. RAISED Seeds Cap
- Cap of 5 is a good baseline
- But clarification: "It's not that you have a cap of five" in the sense of picking top 5 from 1000
- "It's the top ones that meet the cream" -- quality threshold, not quantity cap

### 12. Terminal Aesthetic Preference
- "Off-white blue color like paper, like old receipt paper"
- Text in code-like way
- "I just find it easier to look at over the amount of time that I have to see"
- Can use this aesthetic for ASCII posts/threads -- slides in ASCII with headers as tweets
