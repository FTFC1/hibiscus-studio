This means:\n- They SPECIFY generators, HVAC, electrical systems for every project\n- They write the MEP specifications that contractors follow\n- They are the ones deciding what genset brand, capacity, and configuration goes into 900+ projects\n\n### Direct Evidence\n1. **Cummins Head Office Complex, Lagos** — CCP did the MEP scope. They literally designed the MEP systems for a generator manufacturer's own headquarters. This is Cummins' Nigerian HQ. Ironic opportunity: they already know Cummins specs intimately.\n2. **MEPF listed as top-3 service** — not a footnote. Equal billing with Architecture and Project Management.\n3. **Green Building / LEED consultancy** — sustainability angle means they're already thinking about energy efficiency, hybrid power, gas alternatives.\n4. **Oil & Gas Support Services** — they serve the O&G sector, which is the highest genset density sector in Nigeria.\n\n### Generator Relevance Score\nEvery commercial/institutional/hospitality project CCP designs will include backup power specifications. In Nigeria, that means diesel generators as baseline. For 900+ projects across GTBank HQ, MTN offices, Sheraton hotels, hospitals, and residential towers — the aggregate genset specification volume is enormous.\n\n**Key insight:** CCP is a NODE, not a DIRECT buyer. They don't buy generators — they SPECIFY them. Their specs become the purchase orders that contractors fulfill. One relationship with CCP's MEP team could influence genset specifications across their entire active pipeline.\n\n---\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Source | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Arc.

This is a firm that cares about presentation.\n2. **Three offices including Rwanda** — expansion-minded. Not just Lagos-centric.\n3. **MEPF is not an afterthought** — listed as a primary service line, not buried.\n4. **Green Building / LEED** — active sustainability practice. Green Building Specialist on staff (Arc. Falude Emmanuel Bamiyo).\n5. **Oil & Gas Support Services** — they serve the energy sector directly.\n6. **BIM capability** — technologically current. Not a legacy firm stuck in 2D.\n7. **\"From feasibility to completion and handover\"** — full lifecycle. They're involved from specification through commissioning.\n8. **Client list includes banks, telcos, hospitality, institutional** — all high genset-demand sectors.\n\n### Email Pattern\n`firstname.initial@consultantscollaborative.com` or `f***@consultantscollaborative.com` based on ZoomInfo patterns.\n\n### Phone\n+234 903 800 1564\n\n### Social\n- LinkedIn: [Consultants Collaborative Partnership (CCP)](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/ccp---consultants-collaborative-partnership)\n- Instagram: @CCPLagos\n\n---\n\n## Trigger Hypothesis\n\n### Primary Trigger: MEP Specification Influence (NODE play)\n\n**Thesis:** CCP's in-house MEPF team specifies generators for every project they design. With 8 ongoing projects and a pipeline that feeds from Nigeria's biggest developers and institutions, a relationship with CCP's engineering leadership means Mikano gensets get specified at the design stage — before contractors even start procurement.\n\n**Why now:**\n1. **Green Building pivot** — CCP is investing in LEED/sustainability. Gas generators (Mikano's gas product line) align perfectly with their sustainability push. Diesel-only is becoming harder to justify in green building specs.\n2. **Rwanda expansion** — New market = new specifications. CCP Rwanda projects need MEP specs. If Mikano has East Africa presence, this multiplies.\n3. **8 active projects** — live pipeline where specs are being written right now.\n4. **Cummins HQ connection** — CCP already knows Cummins intimately (they designed their Nigerian HQ). This is either a blocker (Cummins loyalty) or an opener (they know the product category deeply and may be open to alternatives).\n\n### Secondary Trigger: Babalakin Network (ELITE play)\n\n**Thesis:** Tayo Babalakin is not just an architect — he's from one of Nigeria's most connected families. His brother Dr. Wale Babalakin SAN is chairman of Bi-Courtney Group (built the MMA2 terminal at Lagos airport). Their father was a Supreme Court Justice. This family moves in circles where major developments are commissioned.\n\n**Network value:**\n- Babalakin & Co. (law firm) is listed as a CCP client\n- Bi-Courtney Group (aviation, real estate) — likely CCP relationship\n- Day Waterman College — Tayo is on the board\n- ACANigeria (Association of Consulting Architects) — Tayo was President, knows every major architecture firm in Nigeria\n- African Union of Architects — Tayo was VP, continental connections\n\n### Tertiary Trigger: Deji Adeyinka as Entry Point\n\n**Thesis:** Deji Adeyinka is Business Development Manager. His job is literally to build relationships with vendors, clients, and partners. He's the most approachable person on the team for an initial connection. BD people are incentivized to take meetings.\n\n### Approach Angles (ranked)\n1. **Deji Adeyinka (BD Manager)** — warm LinkedIn approach. \"We work with MEP consultancies across Lagos to support their generator specifications. Noticed CCP's impressive portfolio including the Cummins HQ project. Would love to understand how your MEP team currently approaches backup power specification.\"\n2. **Engr. Adediran Akerele (Deputy MD)** — engineering leadership. More technical conversation about gas vs diesel specs, LEED compliance.\n3. **Arc. Falude Emmanuel Bamiyo (Green Building Specialist)** — sustainability angle. Gas generators as part of green building strategy.\n4. **Tayo Babalakin (Founding Partner)** — only via warm intro or high-level industry event. Too senior for cold outreach.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Cummins loyalty** — They designed Cummins' Nigerian HQ. Could mean they default to Cummins specs. Counter: MEP firms spec multiple brands, and Mikano offers competitive pricing + local support.\n- **Architecture-led firm** — Decision-making may prioritize design over engineering. Counter: MEP is a core service line, not outsourced. Engineering partners have real influence.\n- **Large firm = slow process** — 50+ professionals means bureaucracy. Counter: BD Manager (Deji) exists specifically to shortcut this.\n\n---\n\n## Score\n\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Company relevance** | 9/10 | In-house MEPF practice. 900+ projects. Designs buildings that ALL need generators in Nigeria. Commercial, institutional, hospitality — highest genset demand sectors. Green building practice opens gas conversation. |\n| **Trigger strength** | 7/10 | 8 active projects = live specs being written. Green building pivot = gas opportunity. No single \"breaking news\" trigger, but the structural opportunity is strong. Rwanda expansion adds future upside. |\n| **Node value** | 9/10 | This is the NODE play archetype. One relationship here influences specs across their entire portfolio — current and future. Tayo Babalakin's network (ACANigeria President, African Union of Architects VP, Babalakin family) means this node connects to the entire Nigerian architecture establishment. |\n\n**Overall: 8.3/10 — HIGH PRIORITY NODE**\n\n**Classification:** NODE (not DIRECT — they specify, they don't buy)\n**Product Fit:** BOTH (diesel for standard specs, gas for green building / LEED projects)\n**Recommended entry:** Deji Adeyinka (BD Manager) via LinkedIn\n**Recommended angle:** MEP specification support + gas generator for sustainability projects\n\n---\n\n## Sources (80/20)\n\n- 50% — [consultantscollaborative.com](https://www.consultantscollaborative.com/) (website, about, projects, team pages)\n- 20% — [LinkedIn CCP](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/ccp---consultants-collaborative-partnership) + [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/consultants-collaborative-partnership-ccp-management_b44da7e5fd18adab) (people + org chart)\n- 15% — [Guardian Nigeria](https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/tayo-babalakin-architect-par-excellence-joins-league-of-sexagenarians/) + [GCI Museum](http://www.gcimuseum.org/content/babalakin-omotayo-mufutau) (Tayo Babalakin background)\n- 10% — [EstateIntel](https://estateintel.com/app/directory/consultants-collaborative) + [African Architects](https://www.african-architects.com/ccp-consultant-collaborative-partnership-oniru-victoria-island) (project tracking)\n- 5% — [BusinessDay](https://businessday.ng/real-estate/article/ccp-sees-opportunities-for-professionals-in-built-environment/) (industry positioning)\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1662,"cache_read_input_tokens":40033,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1662},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4Q7jyq4Q8z7Fw5uxbk8","type":"assistant","uuid":"25c463ba-aaa2-4d9b-b03f-4df35c6ee2ce","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:20:47.725Z"}

Founded 1990. 900+ projects. Offices in Lagos, Abuja, Kigali (Rwanda). 51-200 employees.\n\n**The critical finding:** CCP has an **in-house MEPF engineering practice** (not outsourced). They SPECIFY generators for every building they design. This makes them a textbook **NODE** -- one relationship here influences genset specifications across their entire active and future portfolio.\n\n## Key People\n\n| Name | Title | Why They Matter |\n|------|-------|----------------|\n| **Deji Adeyinka** | Business Development Manager | Entry point. His job is taking meetings with vendors/partners. |\n| **Tayo Babalakin** | Founding Partner | Brother of Dr. Wale Babalakin SAN (Bi-Courtney Group billionaire). Past President ACANigeria. VP African Union of Architects. Has a Grad Diploma in **Energy Studies** from AA London. |\n| **Enahoro Zedomi** | Managing Partner | Runs day-to-day. BArch UNILAG. |\n| **Adediran Akerele** | Deputy Managing Partner | Engineering leadership. |\n| **Falude Emmanuel Bamiyo** | Green Building Specialist | Sustainability angle for gas gensets. |\n\n## Trigger Angles\n\n1. **MEP Specification Influence** -- 8 active projects with specs being written NOW. Every commercial/institutional building in Nigeria needs backup power.\n2. **Green Building / LEED pivot** -- CCP has a dedicated Green Building Specialist. Gas generators align with sustainability specs. Diesel-only is harder to justify in LEED projects.\n3. **Cummins HQ paradox** -- CCP designed Cummins' Nigerian headquarters (MEP scope). They know generator specs deeply. Either a blocker (loyalty) or an opener (they understand alternatives).\n4. **Babalakin network** -- Tayo's family and professional network (ACANigeria, African Union of Architects, Bi-Courtney Group, Supreme Court family) connects to Nigeria's entire architecture and development establishment.\n\n## Scores\n\n| Dimension | Score |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Company relevance | **9/10** |\n| Trigger strength | **7/10** |\n| Node value | **9/10** |\n| **Overall** | **8.3/10 -- HIGH PRIORITY NODE** |\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n- **Entry:** Deji Adeyinka via LinkedIn\n- **Angle:** MEP specification support + gas generator for green building / LEED projects\n- **Classification:** NODE (they specify, they don't buy)\n- **Product Fit:** BOTH (diesel standard + gas for sustainability projects)\n\n## File Saved\n\n`/Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/trellomcp/trello-mcp/projects/mikano/02-Diesel-First/Lead-Generation/research/CCP-trigger-research.md`\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [CCP Website](https://www.consultantscollaborative.com/)\n- [CCP LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/ccp---consultants-collaborative-partnership)\n- [CCP on EstateIntel](https://estateintel.com/app/directory/consultants-collaborative)\n- [Tayo Babalakin - Guardian Nigeria](https://guardian.ng/saturday-magazine/tayo-babalakin-architect-par-excellence-joins-league-of-sexagenarians/)\n- [Tayo Babalakin - GCI Museum](http://www.gcimuseum.org/content/babalakin-omotayo-mufutau)\n- [CCP on African Architects](https://www.african-architects.com/ccp-consultant-collaborative-partnership-oniru-victoria-island)\n- [CCP Management - RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/consultants-collaborative-partnership-ccp-management_b44da7e5fd18adab)\n- [BusinessDay - CCP opportunities](https://businessday.ng/real-estate/article/ccp-sees-opportunities-for-professionals-in-built-environment/)\n- [Deji Adeyinka LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deji-adeyinka-5b550832/)\n- [Wale Babalakin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wale_Babalakin)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4409,"cache_read_input_tokens":41695,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4409},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4QFFuMAbHeVKSqipiEc","type":"assistant","uuid":"d24d4cd0-5617-40c4-a8ca-8b28681fbfea","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:21:06.561Z"}
