  [MIK] Mikano contacts (Diesel/Gas)       PROFILING STAGE
        19 contacts in cache. NODE-class dominant.
        Status: Research done. No AI services outreach.
        Note: These are MIKANO selling contacts, not
              Aloe Labs AI services prospects. But some
              could become AI services leads (see BTL below).

REFERRAL NETWORK (proven but tiny)
──────────────────────────────────────
  [REF] Fisayo                              7 referrals in 2 min
        Status: Proven node. Not yet asked for AI referrals.
        Next: After PUMA case study exists, ask for intros.

  [REF] Rochelle                            Potential referrer
        Status: Happy client. Not yet asked for referrals.
        Next: After HBS case study packaged, ask for 3 intros.

GAP ANALYSIS
──────────────────────────────────────
  Active clients:    2 (need 3-5 for March north star)
  Pipeline prospects: 1 (GRM only)
  Referral sources:  2 (Fisayo, Rochelle — neither asked yet)
  Case studies:      0 packaged (HBS = could be, PUMA = soon)
  Outreach sent:     0 for AI services
  Email sequences:   0 built
  Weekly meetings:   0 scheduled with new prospects

  VERDICT: Pipeline is CRITICALLY THIN.
           Revenue depends on 2 clients + hope.
           No systematic prospecting happening.
```

## 2. BTL (Below The Line) PROFILES

BTL = profile people below the decision-maker line to gather intel for ATL (above the line) conversations. You are NOT selling to these people. You are learning FROM them.

### BTL Profile #1: Peter (PRL Team)

```
NAME:       Peter
FIRM:       PRL (Puma retail)
ROLE:       Store team member
CONNECTION: Already knows you. Gave feedback ("lessons too long").
BTL VALUE:  Understands floor-level pain. Knows what training
            staff actually want vs what management thinks they want.
INTEL TO GATHER:
  - What tech do staff currently use? (WhatsApp groups? Spreadsheets?)
  - What operational pain would a bot/automation solve?
  - Do other PRL brands have training programs?
  - Who else at PRL would benefit from automation?
APPROACH:   Casual. "Hey Peter, quick question about how the
            team handles [X] day to day..." via WhatsApp.
TIMING:     Before or during PUMA trial (Week 1-2)
```

### BTL Profile #2: Adedolapo (PRL Sales & Ops)

```
NAME:       Adedolapo
FIRM:       PRL
ROLE:       Sales & Ops Lead
CONNECTION: Known contact via Timi/FORJE relationship.
BTL VALUE:  Sees across ALL PRL brands (Puma, Lacoste, etc).
            Knows operational bottlenecks at org level.
INTEL TO GATHER:
  - How many brands does PRL operate? Staff count per brand?
  - What systems do they use for inventory, scheduling, reporting?
  - What is their biggest operational headache right now?
  - Who makes technology/vendor decisions at PRL level?
  - Are there existing automation tools they've tried?
APPROACH:   Frame as: "Making sure the PUMA pilot fits your
            operations. Want to understand the bigger picture
            so we don't build something that clashes."
TIMING:     Week 1 of PUMA trial
```

### BTL Profile #3: Molade (PRL HR)

```
NAME:       Molade
FIRM:       PRL
ROLE:       HR
CONNECTION: Known contact.
BTL VALUE:  HR controls onboarding, training budgets, compliance.
            If PUMA training scales, HR is the buyer/champion.
INTEL TO GATHER:
  - How does PRL currently onboard new staff?
  - What training budget exists per brand? Per year?
  - What is staff turnover like? (High turnover = evergreen
    training demand)
  - Who approves training vendor contracts?
  - Has PRL ever used external training providers before?
APPROACH:   "Quick question about how PRL handles onboarding —
            want to make sure the PUMA program fits your
            existing processes."
TIMING:     Week 2-3 of PUMA trial (after early results show)
```

### BTL Profile #4: SGI Partner (GRM Clothing)

```
NAME:       SGI (Indian partner)
FIRM:       GRM Clothing
ROLE:       Business partner — handles numbers/operations
CONNECTION: Interview already scheduled.
BTL VALUE:  Has the actual business data. Knows margins,
            volume, capacity. Interview is the profiling call.
INTEL TO GATHER:
  - Monthly order volume, AOV, conversion rate
  - Production capacity and bottlenecks
  - Payment methods and collection issues
  - What systems they use (or don't)
  - Biggest business challenge right now
APPROACH:   Already planned — see GRM interview questions.
            Frame as: "Need to understand the business to
            build the right systems for you."
TIMING:     This week or next
```

### BTL Profile #5: Farah Hilal (GRM Branding Partner)

```
NAME:       Farah Hilal
FIRM:       GRM Clothing (branding partner)
ROLE:       Brand, editorial, content direction
CONNECTION: Active collaborator on GRM project.
BTL VALUE:  Knows the luxury retail market. Has contacts
            (Victoria for market research, Vogue photographer).
            Potential node for OTHER luxury retail brands
            that need AI/automation.
INTEL TO GATHER:
  - What other brands/businesses is she connected to?
  - Do any of her contacts struggle with DM-to-sale conversion?
  - What does she see as the biggest gap in luxury retail
    operations in Lagos/London?
  - Would she introduce you to other brand owners after
    GRM results show?
APPROACH:   Natural conversation during GRM collaboration.
            "Who else in your network deals with the same
            DM-to-sale chaos?"
TIMING:     After GRM interview data is back (2-3 weeks)
```

## 3. OUTREACH APPROACH FOR SMALL TAM

### Core Principles

The TAM is small. Every burned lead is a permanent loss. The approach must be:
- **Warm-first** — no cold emails to strangers
- **Value-leading** — give before you ask
- **Relationship-driven** — fits Lagos business culture
- **Patient** — 3-touch minimum before any ask
- **Proof-backed** — case study is the unlock (coming soon)

### The 3-Layer Outreach System

```
LAYER 1: INNER CIRCLE (ask for intros)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Who: Rochelle, Timi, Fisayo, Dad, Farah
Method: Direct ask after delivering value
Script: Below
Volume: 5 people total. Target: 2-3 intros each = 10-15 warm leads.
Timeline: After PUMA case study exists (Week 3-4 of trial)

LAYER 2: WARM NETWORK (relationship reactivation)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Who: Past colleagues, Mikano contacts who might know business owners,
     people from events, old WhatsApp groups
Method: Personal message + brief + "know anyone who..."
Volume: 10-15 messages over 2 weeks
Timeline: Weeks 3-6

LAYER 3: TARGETED COLD-WARM (research-heavy, one at a time)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Who: Specific businesses identified through research
     (luxury retail, workshops, events, training companies)
Method: Research > observe > engage content > DM with insight
Volume: 2-3 per week maximum
Timeline: Ongoing after case studies exist
```

### Email/Message Templates

#### Template 1: Referral Ask (Inner Circle)

```
Subject: Quick favor — 2 minutes

Hey [Name],

Thanks again for [specific thing — e.g., "the PUMA pilot going
live" / "being so responsive on the HBS project"].

I'm starting to work with more businesses on [specific thing
you helped them with — e.g., "automating their customer flow" /
"building training programs for their teams"].

Do you know 2-3 business owners who deal with:
- Too many manual steps in how they handle customers
- Staff that need training but no system to deliver it
- Losing sales because follow-up falls through cracks

Not asking them to buy anything — just want to have a
conversation and see if there's a fit.

Appreciate it either way.

— Nico
```

#### Template 2: Warm Reactivation (Old Contacts)

```
Subject: Been building something interesting

Hey [Name],

Hope you're well. Haven't been in touch in a while.

I've been building AI-powered tools for businesses —
things like automated training platforms, booking systems,
and customer bots. Just finished a project for a PUMA
retail store (sales training for 7 staff) and a workshop
studio in London (full booking + pricing system).

Not pitching — genuinely curious: do you or anyone you
know deal with any of these?

- Staff training that's inconsistent or nonexistent
- Customer inquiries that get lost in DMs/WhatsApp
- Manual processes that eat up hours every week

Would love to catch up regardless. Free for a quick
call this week?

— Nico
```

#### Template 3: Targeted Cold-Warm (Research-Based)

```
Subject: [Specific observation about their business]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific thing — e.g., "you're running your
bookings through Instagram DMs" / "your team seems to be
growing fast based on recent posts"].

I work with businesses like [reference similar client —
e.g., "a workshop studio in London" / "a retail brand
in Lagos"] on automating exactly that kind of thing —
[specific outcome, e.g., "turning DM chaos into a
structured booking flow" / "giving new staff a training
program they complete on their phones"].

Not trying to sell anything — just curious if [the thing
you noticed] is actually a pain point or if you've got
it handled.

Either way, interesting work you're doing with [their brand].

— Nico
```

#### Template 4: WhatsApp Referral (Nigerian Context)

```
Hey [Name], how body?

Quick one — I've been building AI tools for businesses.
Just did a training platform for PUMA staff and a
booking system for a studio in London.

Looking to help more businesses. If you know any
business owner dealing with:
- WhatsApp/DM orders that are chaotic
- Staff training headaches
- Customer follow-up falling through cracks

Connect me, I'll take it from there. No wahala if not.

Thanks boss.
```

### Anti-Burn Rules

1. **Never send more than 1 message to the same person without a response**
2. **Never pitch on first contact** — observe, compliment, ask
3. **Never send bulk messages** — each one is personalized
4. **Follow up exactly once** after 5-7 days, then stop
5. **Always lead with what you've built** (proof), not what you can do (claims)
6. **Track every outreach** in a simple spreadsheet (name, date, channel, response)

### Case Study Structure (Template)

```
TITLE: How PUMA PRL Lekki Increased Basket Size by X%
       with Mobile Sales Training

SUBTITLE: 7 staff. 6 weeks. N45K investment. NX.XM revenue impact.

SECTIONS:
1. THE CHALLENGE
   - Staff had no structured training
   - Cross-selling was inconsistent
   - Basket size stuck at N25K average

2. THE SOLUTION
   - 24 mobile missions (10 min each, on phone)
   - Quiz-validated (80% pass to unlock next)
   - Telegram community for daily reinforcement
   - Manager dashboard for tracking

3. THE RESULTS (numbers)
   - Completion rate: X%
   - Basket size: N25K → NX (X% increase)
   - Items per transaction: 1.3 → X
   - Revenue impact: +NX.XM/month from 7 staff
   - Staff satisfaction: X% recommend to peers

4. WHAT THEY SAID
   - Manager quote
   - Staff quote
   - Business partner quote

5. WHAT'S NEXT
   - Scaling to 20 staff (Phase 1)
   - Adding Lacoste brand (Phase 3)
```

### What Makes This Case Study Powerful

- **Small investment, big result** — N45K in, NX.XM/month out = absurd ROI
- **Relatable** — "staff on phones" is universal, not intimidating tech
- **Nigerian context** — built for N40K Android phones, Lagos retail realities
- **Scalable proof** — "if 7 staff did this, imagine 50"
- **Real numbers** — not "improved engagement," actual revenue change

STEP 1: Ask Rochelle (1 WhatsApp message)
────────────────────────────────────────
"Hey Rochelle, quick favor — I'm putting together a portfolio
of the work I've done. Would love to feature Hibiscus Studio.

Could you share:
1. Roughly how many bookings per month you get now vs before
   the system?
2. Has the calculator/website reduced the repetitive questions
   you were getting?
3. A quick 2-3 sentence testimonial I can use?
   (Something like 'Before working with Nico, we were doing X.
   Now we have Y. It's made Z difference.')

No rush — whenever you get a chance. Thank you!"

STEP 2: Screenshot everything
────────────────────────────
  [ ] Booking page (filled in with example data)
  [ ] Calculator page (showing pricing)
  [ ] Admin dashboard (anonymized)
  [ ] Before/after of pricing page

STEP 3: Write the case study
