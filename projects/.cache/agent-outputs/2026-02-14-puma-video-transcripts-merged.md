# PUMA App Video Feedback — Nicholas (Feb 14, 2026)

3 screen recordings reviewing the deployed PUMA Training app at puma-training.vercel.app.
Total: ~17 minutes.

## Video 1 (5m56s) — Home page + design reference

Okay, so the number of things here, that's all, it'd be good if we had something that
was built using the native camera on iOS that made recording for you by easier, that
I could see what I'm talking about as well, I can see transcription of what I'm saying,
and I know that I'm recording my screen at the same time, just combining those two and
then seeing the volume move so that I know that I can be heard, being able to see the transcription
and being able to look at what I'm looking at like the app on different screens right
now in the arc browser, I could also be in Safari, I could also be in Firefox, anyway
now that I'm looking at this, I think it's saying humor-jaming at the top here, looks very
basic, and JM, it's not clickable, I should click to go to the same thing that Profile does,
just six out of, three out of six missions as a fourth day streak, I think is good, but
then when I think about these cards here, I think having them so low down is pointless,
and I think activity should probably be like a separate type in the, you have home, you
have practice, you have activity, you have profile, maybe we need to take some time to think
about what things we should put at the bottom, this, saying play game, but not saying which
game is a bit pointless, and this is play game and then it shows them the free games, and
it suggests a game, let's do an detail, that would be good, daily review, is that about
submitting a review, is it about service-racing reviews, and so that, and a practice log,
is it view-practice log, what is that action, play, okay, daily review doesn't have an
practice log, it doesn't have an action, now having the module one at the top, and then
you have customer engagement, I don't think this sells it enough, I think like some type
of image could be placed here, or just some type of visual, again this is I think a branding
place where you could have an image, right anyway, you have that there's a game, and you
can see the games that you've completed, and okay so here, this first card, when we look
at the visual hierarchy, although the person is going to look at the card that on, you
can have it top-aligned vertically instead of having it sent to a land, now, there's,
a, okay, I'll tell him, so, there is a design like called skill, I thought this was quite
a good amount of videos on this way, yes, this guy, this guy that you made, so that, I think
there's a number of things here that can be taken in terms of the spacing at the top,
the amount of text, the call out, the trust signal, the contrast, the visual hierarchy, and
the point here is that he has this interaction as well on the page, which I guess we'll get
to it, but I think this is quite smart that he's done this, and then you can see like the
improvement, and this is a smart way to show, so anyway, he has animation which really adds
to it, miss something, suggest a pattern, just having that there, I'm so curious, what does
he have for suggesting? Oh wow, it's just opening and GitHub, and they just make a suggestion,
that is incredible, for our own website, we're definitely going to do that, anyway, then you have
the framework, and this is a really interesting way to show, because what he's done here is he's
taken some of the, he knows that people are technically savvy on, and people that are this specific,
they have specific ways that they want to think of these things, I mean, when you think of
taxonomy, when you think of grouping, and you also think of how fundamental the things are
having them as elements and groups is a very smart way to show everything, and just quickly
showing the framework, and you can click on them, and it shows you, I'm just showing like some
interactivity that I think is good, but also I want paid attention to, for example, the spacing,
the use of color, the fact that the cards are the dark color, and the border is the dark color,
okay, so then, and then he has what simple wire frame adaptations of what is going on, so
he has one for adapt, that's basically what I want, this is why it'd be good to have something
like a reference to skill, slash adapt, for the mobile games, the mobile cards to show information,

## Video 2 (4m58s) — Design framework deep-dive + orchestrator vision

Okay, so this is adapted for a fixed layout to a responsive one.
This is a download your AI harness.
I mean, that concept of having an AI harness specifically in an area, getting the fundamentals
of a specific school of thought and having that as a skill and being able to quote on the
different skills.
Or you may know the screen shot that as a highlighted point that I want to share.
I guess what I should do as I've screen-shotted that is also air drop it.
So all of these highlighted things, I think we should make something as well for this
like air drop to, um, MacBook and then you watching for things that were received via
air drop or something.
This is letting me down and then I'll start working.
Okay, so the way that he's done it as well, it's not too much that this part is horizontal
and then he has a cheat sheet, you can view a cheat sheet and what does that take you to
have a fantastic, see this type of cheat sheet is the type of thing that I need for the
things that I've built as well.
But what would be good if this was the expand to show me an example visually?
What would be better as well would be for there to be a, um, a butler who kind of like
looks at the fundamentals and comes up with a collection based on your task.
So if you imagine this for design, then this for engineering, then this for marketing and
then another one for like operations and another one for like economics and another one for
research and they, they sit in different like orders kind of, those orders are like priority
for what you move through in time.
And that's that formation is kind of like a football team.
So you have, like if you're, if you're on time, you have, you want, there's people that
you want at the very front and they're the most sensitive, right?
They're the ones that are feeding and then the ones at the back, they also at the back
because their things come in delayed, they want the delayed information, but also because
they can now take the outflows that come from the more, um, recent or ones that have
interacted with the reality more recently.
I think that is a good way to now architect these things, but the, the bigger point here
is that I like the size of the text.
I think that this is a good ratio of text to visual, I'll screenshot this as well.
And the fact that he did it interactive, I think it's good, I want to say we do this
exactly, but I'm noting good design because I'm trying to have a pattern library.
And this guy has codified like a massive part of this already and even the concept of having
a skill and he's having it for free and I wonder what it, uh, I wonder if this download
cursor is the thing that, um, is like an affiliate link and then he has a marketplace or download
manually.
Is he just free?
He has it for Gemini CLI, he has it for codecs, whether you put it on appearing, whether
you do your new to eye, whether you start and then he has to work with him or to leave
it to it.
If I click get and touch what happens, uh, interesting, it's an email.
Does it auto, uh, this guy, I like this guy.
To work speaks to himself, he's on job.

## Video 3 (6m56s) — PUMA app detailed walkthrough + fixes

Okay, so now we have this new video as well with our edge rope, and I'll continue what
we were on.
I don't think I can leave this.
I can make the options for that, send as edge rope and icon, I think I'm going to go for
any way.
I'll send a wanderer or other queries, I could just use it, I think this is another separate
piece for any way, okay, so I'm going back here, I'm back to you, so I'm going to go for
here, I'm back to the app that we have, refresh the page, okay, go back, refresh the page,
okay, cool, so start.
When I said this thing about stuff being at the bottom, it always just looks good, but
if we think about something like a jeweling or, okay, if I'm a jeweling or a mess, I don't
have to do this.
This is why it'd be good to have some kind of tool that can just reference exactly the
pattern I'm trying to say without me spending this time not having to deal with something
that has a card of information and some text for that, and we're just going to play around
and look at some apps quickly, okay, so this, okay, as you see how this card looks, right,
this is a useful, I could create invoice, okay, now let me go back, no, yes, this is
not really, I wanted to go back to that thing that I screen-shared, add, no, okay, this
is not the type of app that we want for this, so I have a type of app that we want for this,
I need to just look at all of my apps, recently added ones, was it looking for even, yeah,
anyway, I just think that this is good, but there's still be something in this list, there should
also be something that tells me here that I can swipe to go right and swipe to go, see my
swipe to go right goes right, but my swipe to go back sends me back, I have to swipe the card,
see, the hit area should be the whole screen for swiping, otherwise, they're just going to slide back
on them as well, and it's going to be confusing, so yeah, what they actually mean, nine out of ten,
never come back, swipe five hidden meetings, not sure, is worth the price, need to ask someone to,
this, not sure if I've asked the price, need to ask someone, is the information that is needed,
a bit more detail, and you've made it even less clear than the information above that you've
designed, I like the fact that you've done the translation tool for what they actually mean,
that I think that is an interesting thing, and in the accent color with the gray and the white,
again, you have so much space to make a better point, the free step framework with the gray
icon is good, the acknowledge with the icon with the colon is just reducing it, thus totally fair,
can I ask what's making you think it over, this should be like something that they see each one,
and they confirm that they've seen it, and they confirm all they like, yeah, I don't know,
this should be something to acknowledge this framework, the fact that again, the more detailed
thing is not as well designed as the tech, and it's just plain texas, it doesn't make sense,
yes, you have the color on the, on the number, but outside of that doesn't make sense,
this is better, but then the arrow should point down what you have downward space,
and the text should be bigger, and I think I'll think about it,
totally fair, is it the price, sort of fair, the price, now you can help,
and show like a tick or something, this can be bigger, and then try this today, you can already
see on my screen that the sticky bar, it needs to be dynamically coming up, because otherwise
it's too far, but this save button, all right, this is the reference, okay, the reference is
cool, and it's in a good place, but you probably don't know this is reference, so it should be a
button, an outline button of the word reference, and then that icon, this try this today,
the fact that this requires, this requires checkports requires the person to stay on this screen,
so I think even though it looks good, I think you have to have a button to like add this to
today, or I'm ready for today, or ready to practice this today, or start the day, or I'm starting
my day, something like that, or exactly start quiz, but it shouldn't be so low down, okay,
start quiz, we haven't built yet, and then if I go like this, it takes you back, okay, we have the two
views, I think when you're making these, you should have something to show me what's new,
but yeah, so you have five staff, the school, the team progressed, who is ahead,
yeah, all of this, team I took, this is this, the manager view is great,
but if the manager view has this here, then obviously games as the thing at the bottom doesn't
make sense, profile looks good, looks good, it should be like a request help or support,
yeah, request helps makes a support ticket, then I find out about it, and they can use voice
in order to explain what the issue is, and then it will correct, similar to what we already have
with the HPS helper bot, but does it on screen, I'll think about it, we click here, okay, we've
already gone through this, and then we scroll down, yeah, so these things down here, I think
are a bit weird, and I think the options are never a bit weird, but as a whole, and maybe the
three of six missions, like it's not the best thing to be there now anymore, because there's a little
bit, two things are competing, but Jeremy's veganism is coming in on very nicely, and this
process of giving this visual articulation is something that we can use to make case for these
and tear down to people's apps that can create content.
