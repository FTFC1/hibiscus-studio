## Video 1 (5.9 min) — Home + skill.adapt reference

Okay, so there's a number of things here. First of all, it'd be good if we had something that was built using a native camera on iOS that made recording feedback easier, that I could see what I'm talking about as well. I can see transcription of what I'm saying and I know that I'm recording my screen at the same time, just combining those two and then seeing the volume move so that I know that I can be heard, being able to see the transcription and being able to look at what I'm looking at, like the app on different screens. So right now I'm in the ARC browser, I could also be in Safari, I could also be in Firefox.

Anyway, now that I'm looking at this, I think it's saying humor training at the top here, looks very basic. And JM, it's not clickable, that should click to go to the same thing that Profile does. There's three out of six missions as a four-day streak. I think it's good. But then when I think about these cards here, I think having them so low down is pointless. And I think activity should probably be like a separate tab in the, you have home, you have practice, you have activity, you have profile. Maybe we need to take some time to think about what things we should put at the bottom.

This saying play game, but not saying which game is a bit pointless, unless it's play game and then it shows them the free games. And it suggests again, that's the only thing that would be good. Daily review. Is that about submitting a review? If it's about submitting a review, it should show that. And the practice log, is it view practice log? What is the action? Play, okay, daily review doesn't have an action, and practice log doesn't have an action.

Now having the module one at the top. And then you have customer engagement. I don't think this sells it enough. I think like some type of image could be placed here. Or just some type of visual. Again, this is I think a branding place where you could have an image.

But anyway, you have that there's a game and you can see the games that you've completed. And okay, so here this first card, when we look at the visual hierarchy, although the person is going to look at the card dead on, you can have it top aligned vertically instead of having it sent to the land.

[Interruption: conversation with someone else about "Bookie"]

So, there is a design, like, called skill. I thought this was quite a good... So, I think there's a number of things here that can be taken in terms of the spacing at the top, the amount of text, the callout, the trust signal, the contrast, the visual hierarchy. And the point here is that he has this interaction as well on the page, which I guess we'll get to it, but I think this is quite smart that he's done this. And then you can see, like, the improvement. And this is a smart way to show this. Anyway, he has animation which really adds to it.

Miss something, suggest a pattern. Ah, that, just having that there, I'm so curious. What does he have for suggesting? Oh, wow. It's just opening in GitHub and they just make a suggestion. That is incredible. Ah, for our own website, we're definitely going to do that.

Anyway, then you have the framework. And this is a really interesting way to show, because what he's done here is he's taken something that he knows that people are technically savvy on. And people that are this specific, they have specific ways that they want to think of these things. And they, when you think of taxonomy, when you think of grouping, and you also think of how fundamental the things are, having them as elements and grouped is a very smart way to show everything. And it's just quickly showing the framework. And you can click on them and it shows you, I'm just showing like some interactivity that I think is good.

But also I won't pay attention to, for example, the spacing, the use of color, the fact that the cards are the dark color and the border is the dark color. Okay. So then, and then he has what simple wireframe adaptations of what is going on. So he has one for adapt, right? So that's, that's basically what I want. Right? I want, this is why it'd be good to have something that can reference the skill. So let's go slash adapt for the mobile games, no, mobile cards to show information.

## Video 2 (5.0 min) — skill.adapt continued + butler/formation concept

Okay so this is adapt for a fixed layout to responsive one. It says download your AI harness. I mean that concept of having an AI harness specifically in an area, getting the fundamentals of a specific school of thought and having that as a skill and being able to call on the different skills. I'm even going to screenshot that as a highlighted point that I want to share.

I guess what I should do as I've screenshotted that is also airdrop it so all of these highlighted things get sent. I think we should make something as well for this like airdrop to MacBook and then you watching for things that were received via airdrop or something. This is letting me down I don't know it's not working.

Okay so the way that he's done it as well it's not too much is that this part is horizontal and then he has a cheat sheet you can view a cheat sheet and what does that take you to. Fantastic. See this type of cheat sheet is the type of thing that I need for the things that I've built as well. But what would be good if this would expand to show me an example visually.

What would be better as well would be for there to be a butler who kind of like looks at the fundamentals and comes up with a concoction based on your task. So if you imagine this for design, then this for engineering, then this for marketing, and then another one for like operations, and another one for like economics, and another one for research. And they sit in different like orders, kind of those orders are like priority for what you move through in time.

And that formation is kind of like a football team. So you have like if you're in time, there's people that you want at the very front and they're the most sensitive, right? They're the ones that are feeling. And then the ones at the back, they're also at the back because their things come in delayed, they want the delayed information. But also because they can now take the outflows that come from the more recent, or ones that have interacted with the reality more recently.

I think that is a good way to now architect these things. But the bigger point here is that I like the size of the text. I think that this is a good ratio of text to visual. I'll screenshot this as well. And the fact that he did it interactive I think is good. I'm not saying we do this exactly but I'm noting good design because I'm trying to have a pattern library.

And this guy has codified like a massive part of this already. And even the concept of having a skill. And he's having it for free. And I wonder if this download cursor is a thing that is like an affiliate link and he has a marketplace. Or download manually, is it just free? He has it for Gemini CLI, he has it for Codex. Where do you put it? They aren't appearing, what do you do? You're new to AI, where do you start? And then he has to work with him or to leave a tip. Right click, get in touch, what happens? Interesting, it's an email. Does it auto... this guy, I like this guy. The work speaks to itself. He's on job.

## Video 3 (6.9 min) — Back to PUMA app + lesson feedback

Okay so now we have this new video as well with our airdrop and I'll continue what we were on. I don't think I can leave this. I'll send as airdrop and iCloud anyway. I wonder what other call ways I could just use it. I think this is another separate piece anyway.

Okay so I'm going back here. I'm back to the app that we have, refresh the page. Okay go back and refresh the page. Okay cool.

So start — when I said this thing about stuff being at the bottom, like obviously this looks good but if we think about something like a Duolingo. Okay if I'm a Duolingo Math, I don't want to have to deal with this. This is why it'd be good to have some kind of tool that can just reference exactly the pattern I'm trying to say without me spending this time.

Not having to deal with something that has a card of information and some text for that. I'm just gonna, we're just gonna play around and look at some apps quickly.

[Browsing other apps for reference — invoice app, etc.]

Anyway I just think that this is good but this should still be something in this space. There should also be something that tells me here that I can swipe to go right. And swipe to go, see my swipe to go right goes right but my swipe to go back sends me back. I have to swipe the card — see, the hit area should be the whole screen for swiping, otherwise they're just gonna slide back on their mobile and it's gonna be confusing.

[Lesson page feedback:]

As the text and it's just plain text, it doesn't make sense. Yes you have the color on the number, but outside of that it doesn't make sense.

This is better but then the arrow should point downwards. You have downward space. And the text should be bigger.

And I think I'll think about it. Totally fair, is it the price or the fit? The price, now you can help. And then show like a tick or something. But this can be bigger.

And then try this today — you can already see on my screen that the sticky bar, it needs to be dynamically coming up because otherwise it's too far back. This save button.

Oh right, this is the reference. Okay the reference is cool and it's in a good place. But it should — you probably don't know that it says reference. So it should be a button, an outline button with the word reference and then the icon.

This "try this today" — the fact that this requires, this requires checkpoints, requires the person to stay on their screen. So I think even though it looks good, I think you have to have a button to like "add this to today" or "I'm ready for today" or "ready to practice this today" or "start the day" or "I'm starting my day." Something like that. Or exactly "start quiz." But it shouldn't be so low down.

Okay start quiz, we haven't built yet. And then if I go like this it takes me back.

Okay we have the two views. I think when you're making these, you should have something to show me what's new.

But yeah so you have five staff, the score, the team progress, who is ahead. Yep all of this, team active. This is this. The manager view is great. But if the manager view has this here, then obviously games as the thing at the bottom doesn't make sense.

Profile looks good. Looks good. It should be like a request help or support. Yeah, request help makes a support ticket that then I find out about. And they can use voice in order to explain what the issue is and then it will correct. Similar to what we already have with the HBS helper bot but it does it on screen.

I'll think about it. We click here, okay we've already gone through this. And then we scroll down. Yeah so these things down here, I think are a bit weird. And I think the options are never a bit weird but as a whole. And maybe the three of six missions, like it's not the best thing to be there now anymore because it looks like two things are competing.

But Puma's app is coming along very nicely. And this process of giving this visual articulation is something that we can use to make case studies and teardown people's apps that can create content.
