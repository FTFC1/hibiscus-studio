# Session Research: Patterns, Decisions, Energy, Gaps

**Agent:** session-researcher

**Sources:** 4 pickups, 15+ session packets (Feb 1-14), baseline self-assessment, MEMORY.md

## 1. DECISION PATTERNS (what keeps getting decided and re-decided)

### A. "PUMA is top priority" — decided at least 5 times

- Feb 9 session: "Priority order confirmed: (1) Pipeline execution, (2) HB Studio, (3) Puma prep for Thursday"
- Feb 12 pickup: "PUMA remains top priority before new builds"
- Feb 13 brain dump: "Puma needs cleaner interface (not just compressed lessons)"
- Feb 14 mega braindump: PUMA is Thread 1 in the thread map
- Feb 14 pickup: "PUMA client work (confirmed top priority before new builds)"

**Signal:** PUMA keeps being declared priority but keeps getting displaced by other work. The fact that it needs to be re-stated as priority is itself evidence it's not being treated as priority in practice. The demo happened Feb 12 (trial approved), but by Feb 14 the actual trial prep (compress lessons, get TG accounts, set up reporting) is still not done. It's been 2 days since trial was approved.

### B. "Don't build more systems, close more" — decided at least 4 times

- Feb 1 infrastructure day: "Internal projects get 2 design sessions max, then must ship v1 or park"
- Feb 13 brain dump ROOT BLOCKER: "Not knowing where to look in office time and what is my offer"
- Feb 14 baseline: "Biggest risk: Building operating systems when you should be operating"
- Feb 14 baseline: "Don't need to learn more. Need to close more."

**Signal:** This is the single most repeated insight. It appears in nearly every reflective session. Yet the system sprint (Feb 1-14) was itself 14 days of system-building. The user is highly aware of the pattern but the pull toward building is stronger than the resolve to close.

### C. "HBS offer is still undefined" — appears at least 3 times

- Feb 13 brain dump: "HBS offer still undefined — this is the core gap"
- Feb 12 conv ops checkpoint: multiple items extracted but not actioned
- Feb 13 FGCH: "ganache launches MAY (not now), March blocked (Rochelle traveling)"

**Signal:** The HBS work keeps being shaped and re-shaped (ganache page, payment research, booking backend, calculator, variant handoff) but the core commercial offer — what Nicholas sells and for how much — remains undefined. Lots of infrastructure, no price tag. The ganache page copy is written but the BUSINESS MODEL for Aloe Labs serving HBS is not.

### D. Build order keeps shifting

- Jan 27-31: HB booking system is the focus
- Feb 2: Generator sales strategy pivot (Mikano focus)
- Feb 4: HB booking fixes + deployment (back to HB)
- Feb 9: Pipeline execution + PUMA prep
- Feb 12: PUMA demo (shipped!) then immediately Conv Ops Platform exploration
- Feb 13: FGCH ganache shaping (HBS pivots to Flour Girls angle) + DSG/Clodura + Aloe bot
- Feb 14: PUMA lesson slides + video pipeline + The Nest generator deal + agent teams + /pickup skill + self-reflection

**Signal:** The build order is not a queue — it's a rotation. Things get touched, advanced partially, then rotated out for the next thing. This isn't necessarily bad (parallel progress), but it means nothing reaches "done" quickly. The only things that ship cleanly are: bug fixes (HB booking deployment = 1h, done), demo prep (PUMA demo = under pressure, shipped), and tools/skills (/pickup, /capture, /recursive).

## 2. AVOIDANCE PATTERNS (what keeps getting PARKED or postponed)

### A. Revenue conversations — consistently deferred

- HBS: Pricing defined (£350/£650/£900 tiers) but no conversation with Rochelle about what NICHOLAS charges for building it. The Aloe Labs pricing anchors exist ($300-$2500/mo) but have never been presented to a client.
- PUMA: "Normally paid, I convinced him to waive it" (Timi's framing). 6-week free trial. No pricing conversation scheduled.
- GRM: "waiting" — appears on every board listing since Feb 4, never advances.
- Mikano: The Nest deal needs manager approval for 33% discount — this is the closest to an actual sale, and it's a generator sale, not a tech sale.

**Signal:** Building things is comfortable. Having the money conversation is not. Every client relationship has extensive technical work but no billing. The baseline self-assessment rates Execution Velocity at 3/5 specifically for "systems-before-revenue tendency."

### B. Content creation / proof of work — repeatedly noted, never started

- Feb 12: "Case study flywheel = document every client automatically" — idea logged
- Feb 12: "Case study bot concept — auto-document every client engagement. Not built, not designed."
- Feb 14: "HBS case study — build product FIRST, case study follows" (keeps pushing case study to AFTER build, but build keeps extending)
- /vv skill built Feb 13 (Visualise Value — for creating proof) — but no actual /vv output exists yet.

**Signal:** The user correctly identifies that proof/content is the trust gap (Upwork analysis: "Trust edge = weakest"). Yet proof creation keeps being deferred to "after the build is done" — but builds never fully finish because scope expands.

### C. Outreach / selling the tech services — the biggest gap

- Clodura TAM search: appears on every board since Feb 4. Status = "needs ASCII system design before fan-out." Has not been started.
- DSG profiling: Mario Abugo profiled (one person). Then parked.
- Pipeline volume target: "progressive build to 15/day by Week 8" — current actual volume = 0 active outreach on tech services.
- GRM follow-up: "waiting" since Feb 4. No follow-up sent.

**Signal:** Outreach for tech services (not generators) has never actually started. The pipeline infrastructure exists (rubrics, scoring, Notion DB, contact cache) but zero prospects have been contacted with a tech service offer. All client work (HBS, PUMA) came through existing relationships, not outreach.

### D. Emotional regulation system — identified as biggest gap, no action taken

- Feb 14 baseline: Emotional Regulation = 2/5, "BIGGEST GAP. No system. Running on willpower."
- Daily journaling proposed but no format chosen, no first entry made.
- Sunday review planned for Feb 16 but no structure beyond "compare to baseline."

## 3. ENERGY PATTERNS (what gets done fastest, what the user gravitates toward)

### HIGH ENERGY (fast execution, deep flow)

1. **Building React/HTML components** — PUMA lesson slides (Lesson.jsx, Lesson.css) got multiple iterations with user feedback in one session. Calculator explore.html built and deployed. Speaker notes iterated 4 times.
2. **System architecture / ASCII design** — Thread maps, flywheel diagrams, the I/O model, vertical scoring matrices. These get produced rapidly and with sophistication.
3. **Processing voice notes / brain dumps** — /process-convo handles massive inputs. 62 items extracted from one mega braindump. The user generates ideas at extreme volume.
4. **Building skills and tools** — /pickup, /capture, /recursive, /scaffold, /vv, /dsg, /small-bets, /grok all built in ~3 days (Feb 11-13). This is where the system sprint energy went.
5. **Research and analysis** — Olly Rosewell video (9-section analysis), OpenClaw adaptation, 12 Traits framework, Greg Isenberg 8-lens analysis. Deep analytical work happens fast.
6. **Bug fixes under pressure** — HB 2-hour slot bug: identified, analyzed, fixed, deployed in 1 hour. When there's a clear problem with clear impact, execution is immediate.

### LOW ENERGY (slow, keeps getting deferred)

1. **Pricing conversations with clients** — never happens without external forcing (Timi drove the PUMA trial framing)
2. **Cold outreach / prospecting** — infrastructure built, zero executions
3. **Content creation for distribution** — /vv exists but no output. No X threads, no case studies, no portfolio page.
4. **Follow-up on parked deals** — GRM hasn't been touched in 10+ days
5. **Lesson compression / content editing** — PUMA lessons "too long" (Peter + Adedolapo feedback, Feb 12), still not compressed by Feb 14
6. **Defining the commercial offer** — "What is my offer?" keeps being the root blocker, keeps not being answered

## 4. THE SAY-DO GAP

### What the user SAYS matters most

From the baseline self-assessment and brain dumps:
1. **"Close the builds"** — HBS, PUMA, GRM = 3 paying pattern
2. **"Drive the engine, not build more systems"**
3. **"Revenue is the path to the North Star"** — own office, own schedule, gym freedom
4. **"Need to close more, not learn more"**

### What the user actually SPENDS TIME on

From the session evidence (Feb 1-14):

| Activity | Estimated Hours | Revenue Impact |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| System/skill building (/pickup, /capture, streams, HUD, etc.) | ~25h | None (internal) |
| PUMA build (slides, demo, quiz bot) | ~15h | Potential (trial approved, not paid) |
| HBS build (booking fixes, calculator, ganache shaping) | ~12h | Potential (no billing conversation) |
| Research/analysis (videos, frameworks, EP, OpenClaw) | ~10h | None (learning) |
| Generator sales (The Nest, pipeline rubric) | ~5h | Direct (Mikano commission) |
| Mikano pipeline infra (Clodura, DSG profiling) | ~4h | Indirect |
| Self-reflection (baseline, 12 traits) | ~2h | None (important but not revenue) |
| **Actual client outreach / pricing conversations** | **~0h** | **The gap** |

### The core tension

The user has built a sophisticated operating system for a business that doesn't have paying clients yet (outside of Mikano generator sales). The system is genuinely impressive — skills, HUD, session maps, memory, pickups, video-kb — but it's all infrastructure for a revenue engine that hasn't started.

The baseline self-assessment is remarkably self-aware: "Building operating systems when you should be operating." But awareness hasn't yet converted to behavior change. The Feb 1-14 sprint was overwhelmingly system-building (Skills + CLAUDE.md + HUD + stream management) with client work happening in reactive bursts (PUMA demo because meeting was scheduled, HB fixes because bugs were blocking revenue).

### What actually ships and why

Things that ship have ONE thing in common: **external deadlines or external pressure.**

- HB booking fixes: deployed because bugs were live and blocking
- PUMA demo: shipped because meeting was on the calendar
- The Nest analysis: done because customer meeting is Monday
- /pickup skill: built because current session needed it

Things that DON'T ship: anything where the only deadline is self-imposed.

## 5. SUMMARY: THE THREE PATTERNS THAT MATTER

### Pattern 1: Builder identity vs. Closer identity

The user identifies as a "technical operator" and gravitates toward building. Closing (pricing conversations, outreach, follow-up) is the acknowledged weak spot but receives near-zero time investment. The 12 Traits baseline confirms this: Cross-Domain Synthesis 5/5, Execution Velocity 3/5, Emotional Regulation 2/5.

### Pattern 2: Scope expansion masking avoidance

Every project starts focused and then expands:
- PUMA: quiz bot → training app → conversational ops platform → 5-engine architecture
- HBS: booking fixes → calculator → ganache page → payment research → corporate outreach plan
- Internal: /briefing → skills → stream management → HUD → video-kb → agent teams

Expansion feels productive (and often IS productive in terms of learning/architecture), but it delays the moment where the user has to say "this costs X, will you pay?" The ganache page copy exists but "what does Nicholas charge for building this?" doesn't.

### Pattern 3: The system IS the procrastination

The most honest line in the baseline: "Building operating systems when you should be operating." The system sprint was valuable — the tools are genuinely useful — but 14 days of system-building with no revenue conversations is itself the pattern. The next system, the next skill, the next framework adaptation — they're all real work, but they're also all safer than sending the first invoice.

## 6. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR TONIGHT'S SESSION

The leverage question isn't "what to build." The leverage question is: **which ONE action creates irreversible forward motion toward money?**

Candidates (ranked by irreversibility):
1. Send Rochelle a pricing email for the Aloe Labs services she's already receiving
2. Compress PUMA Module 1 and send to Timi with trial start date confirmation
3. Send GRM a follow-up message (breaks 10-day silence)
4. Prep The Nest 33% discount request for Monday morning
5. Write the first /vv case study draft for HBS booking system

None of these are builds. All of them are closes.
