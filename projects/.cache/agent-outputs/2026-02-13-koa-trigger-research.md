The firm's DNA is electrical-first.\n- **Africa Data Center (Eko Atlantic):** This project requires 20.65 MW critical IT load with 72-hour backup generator fuel capacity. KOA provided MEP consulting for this. The genset requirements for a Rated-3 data center are massive -- likely multiple 2-3 MW diesel generators.\n- **Transcorp Hilton Abuja:** KOA served as \"Service Engineer\" on the renovation. A 5-star, 670-room hotel in Abuja requires standby power in the 2-5 MW range.\n- **Massey Children Hospital:** 210-bed, 8-floor hospital with an Independent Power Plant. KOA was MEP consultant. Hospital-grade power = continuous-rated gensets, likely 1-2 MW.\n- **Marriott Ikeja (250-room):** 5-star hotel MEP = genset spec in the 1-2 MW range.\n- **The Citadel (5,500-seater auditorium):** Large venue = 500kW-1MW standby.\n\n### Genset Sizing Estimates (based on building types)\n| Building Type | Typical Genset Range | KOA Project Example |\n|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 5-star hotel (250+ rooms) | 1.5-3 MW | Marriott Ikeja, Transcorp Hilton |\n| Data center (Rated-3) | 2-3 MW x multiple units | Africa Data Center Eko Atlantic |\n| Hospital (150-210 bed) | 1-2 MW | Massey Children, Lagos American |\n| Large retail mall (27,000+ m2) | 500kW-1.5 MW | Ikeja City Mall, Ado Bayero Mall |\n| University campus | 500kW-1 MW per building | James Hope University |\n| Convention center | 500kW-1 MW | Calabar Int'l Convention Centre |\n\n**Bottom line:** KOA does NOT sell generators. They SPECIFY them. They write the specs that determine which brand/model gets purchased. This makes them a **NODE** -- one relationship with KOA influences generator selection across multiple projects per year.\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Credentials | Source | Notes |\n|------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|\n| **Ibikunle S.

Covers HVAC/mechanical -- adjacent to power. |\n| **Lawrence Adetogun** | Associate Director | MNSE | [Website](https://koaconsultants.com/management-team-2/) | 20+ years. 14+ years at KOA. |\n| **Kayode Awoleye** | MEP Engineer | -- | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Kayode-Awoleye/13058601294) | Hands-on MEP engineer -- writes the actual specs. |\n| **Chukwudi Ilo** | Project Manager | -- | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Chukwudi-Ilo/-1616274098), [LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/in/chukwudi-ilo-b700a422) | PM on active projects. |\n| **Rosemary Ifeonye** | Senior Manager | -- | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Rosemary-Ifeonye/-1878813110), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosemary-ifeonye-9019b74) | Sr. Manager. |\n| **Ibrahim Olabode** | Assistant Project Engineer | -- | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahim-olabode-70a0432b/) | Junior engineer. |\n| **Olaotan Olawale** | Admin & HR Senior Manager | -- | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Olaotan-Olawale/-1613032163) | HR contact for intro/meeting setup. |\n| **Samuel Folarin** | Finance Executive | -- | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Samuel-Folarin/7395430669) | Finance. |\n| **Gbenga Alabi** | IT/Infrastructure Support Engineer | MCSE, MTCNA, MTCRE | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbenga-alabi-1031a0b8/) | IT infrastructure, not MEP. |\n\n### Key Approach Targets (in priority order)\n1. **Abiodun Ajayi (Director, Electrical Eng)** -- Reviews/approves electrical specs including gensets. Technical decision-maker.\n2. **Adetokunbo Sangowawa (MD)** -- Commercial decision-maker. Relationship with vendors.\n3. **Kayode Awoleye (MEP Engineer)** -- Writes the specs. Ground-level influencer.\n4. **Ibikunle Ogunbayo (Chairman)** -- Ultimate authority, but likely too senior for cold approach. Best reached through referral or ACEN/COREN network.\n\n## Trigger Hypotheses\n\n### 1. Active Construction Pipeline (9 ongoing projects)\n- **Trigger Type:** Product (active demand for genset specs)\n- **Signal Strength:** HOT\n- **Evidence:** Estate Intel shows 9 ongoing projects. Each project in their portfolio requires genset specification. At a minimum, 4-6 of those 9 projects will need generator specs written this year.\n- **Recommended Approach:** \"We see KOA has [X project] underway. Mikano has supplied gensets for similar [hotel/hospital/commercial] builds. Can we share our spec sheets for your electrical team's consideration?\"\n\n### 2. Hiring Signal -- Building Services Engineer Role\n- **Trigger Type:** Hiring (capacity expansion = more projects incoming)\n- **Signal Strength:** WARM\n- **Evidence:** LinkedIn job posting for \"Building Services Engineer\" (posted late 2024/early 2025). KOA also posted via Synetronics Nigeria recruitment partner for \"Exciting Career Openings.\"\n- **Recommended Approach:** Growing team = growing project pipeline = more genset specs being written. Time the approach to coincide with new projects being staffed.\n\n### 3. Data Center Boom -- Eko Atlantic\n- **Trigger Type:** Industry (data center construction wave in Lagos)\n- **Signal Strength:** HOT\n- **Evidence:** KOA was MEP consultant for Africa Data Center at Eko Atlantic (20.65 MW). Airtel just announced $120M AI-focused data center at Eko Atlantic. More data centers = more massive generator requirements (72-hour backup is standard). KOA is positioned as the go-to MEP consultant for this sector.\n- **Recommended Approach:** \"With the Eko Atlantic data center expansion, Mikano's industrial-grade gensets are designed for Rated-3 facility requirements. We'd welcome the opportunity to be considered for upcoming data center projects.\"\n\n### 4. Healthcare Expansion (Lagos State)\n- **Trigger Type:** Industry (government healthcare infrastructure push)\n- **Signal Strength:** WARM\n- **Evidence:** Lagos State is building/renovating multiple hospitals (Massey Children, Ojo GH, Somolu GH). KOA has done Massey Children (210-bed), Ibom Specialist, Lagos American Specialist. Hospital power = mission-critical = premium gensets with automatic transfer switches.\n- **Recommended Approach:** Hospital projects require Class F continuous-rated generators with redundancy. Position Mikano as hospital-grade supplier.\n\n### 5. International Expansion (Ghana)\n- **Trigger Type:** Financial/Product (geographic expansion = new market projects)\n- **Signal Strength:** COLD\n- **Evidence:** KOA has completed projects in Ghana (Zenith Bank HQ Accra, Maersk House Tema). If they continue West African expansion, generator specs will follow.\n- **Recommended Approach:** Lower priority. Monitor for new Ghana/West Africa project announcements.\n\n### 6. Founder/Chairman's Network Position\n- **Trigger Type:** Industry (network influence)\n- **Signal Strength:** HOT (as NODE value)\n- **Evidence:** Ibikunle Ogunbayo is **past President of COREN** and **past President of ACEN**. This means he sits at the center of Nigeria's engineering consulting network. A relationship here unlocks not just KOA projects but referrals to other ACEN member firms.\n- **Recommended Approach:** Engage through ACEN/COREN events or industry conferences. Do NOT cold-call the Chairman. Find a warm introduction path.\n\n## Website Intel\n\n### Services Listed\n- Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Engineering\n- Renewable and Sustainable Energy Solutions\n- Energy certification compliance solutions\n- Full-range consultancy for commercial, industrial, schools, hospitals, infrastructure\n\n### Website Structure\n- Two live domains: `koaconsultants.com` (primary, modern) and `website.koaconsultants.com` (legacy)\n- Projects portfolio page with individual project case studies\n- Management team page with full bios\n- Careers/jobs section (active)\n- Contact page with Lagos office details\n\n### Notable Observations\n- Website emphasizes \"future-proofing\" and \"sustainable energy\" -- position Mikano gas generators (not just diesel) as aligned with their sustainability messaging\n- ISO 9001 + ISO 2015 certified -- they value quality documentation. Approach with proper spec sheets, not just brochures.\n- 40-year anniversary (1985-2025) -- may have had celebrations/events. Good conversation opener.\n\n## Score\n\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Company Relevance** | 9/10 | Full-service MEP consultancy. Every project they touch needs genset specs. Exact target profile for Mikano. |\n| **Trigger Strength** | 8/10 | 9 active projects, hiring, data center boom, healthcare expansion. Multiple concurrent triggers. |\n| **Node Value** | 10/10 | This is a PREMIER node. Chairman is past President of both COREN and ACEN. 9+ ongoing projects per year. One relationship here = influence over generator selection on potentially 5-10 projects annually. The Fisayo-equivalent multiplier is enormous. |\n| **Overall Priority** | **HIGH** | Top-tier target. NODE approach (not DIRECT). Engage through Abiodun Ajayi (electrical director) or find a warm path to the MD. Do not cold-approach the Chairman. |\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n1. **Check contact cache** -- see if any existing contacts have a connection to KOA, ACEN, or Ogunbayo family\n2. **LinkedIn research** -- connect with Kayode Awoleye (MEP Engineer) or Abiodun Ajayi (Director, Electrical) as the entry point\n3. **ACEN member list** -- cross-reference with other prospects in the pipeline. KOA's ACEN membership means they attend the same events as other MEP consultancies\n4. **Prepare spec package** -- Mikano product sheets formatted for MEP consultants (not end-users). Include: kVA ranges, fuel consumption tables, ATS compatibility, noise levels, emission compliance\n5. **Track active projects** -- Monitor Estate Intel for new KOA project listings. Each new project announcement = fresh outreach trigger\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [KOA Consultants Official Website](https://koaconsultants.com/)\n- [KOA Management Team Page](https://koaconsultants.com/management-team-2/)\n- [KOA Consultants LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/koa-consultants-ltd)\n- [Estate Intel - KOA Consultants](https://estateintel.com/app/directory/koa-consultants-limited)\n- [RocketReach - KOA Consultants](https://rocketreach.co/koa-consultants-ltd-profile_b5d54492f42e3a3f)\n- [ZoomInfo - Adetokunbo Sangowawa](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Adetokunbo-Sangowawa/-1709200714)\n- [ZoomInfo - Kayode Awoleye](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Kayode-Awoleye/13058601294)\n- [LinkedIn - Ibikunle Ogunbayo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibikunle-s-ogunbayo-57247737/)\n- [Africa Data Centres Lagos](https://www.africadatacentres.com/lagos/)\n- [My Engineers - History of Nigerian Engineering Firms](https://www.myengineers.com.ng/2021/09/10/history-of-nigerian-engineering-firms/)\n- [ACEN Members List](https://acen.org.ng/members/)\n- [Punch - Massey Children Hospital Inspection](https://punchng.com/sanwo-olu-inspects-seven-storey-massey-children-hospital/)\n- [Lagos Ministry of Health - Infrastructure Transformation](https://lagosministryofhealth.org/lagos-medical-infrastructure-transformation-new-massey-childrens-hospital-ojo-somolu-ghs-others-promise-improved-healthcare-accessibility/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":311,"cache_read_input_tokens":36157,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":311},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY5sDu1cnDMfyPgsQBZLe","type":"assistant","uuid":"cdcaaf9e-afdd-49c3-b65a-4e99d5640802","timestamp":"2026-02-13T09:56:48.600Z"}
