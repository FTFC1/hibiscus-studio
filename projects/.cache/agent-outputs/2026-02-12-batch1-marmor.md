The company is trusted by more than 50% of Nigeria's malls.\n\n## Projects Portfolio\n\nThe search results mention one specific project from their portfolio:\n\n- **Blackbell Mall Ikota**: Blackbell Mall Ikota is a recently completed commercial development in Lagos, Nigeria, for which MAR&MOR was responsible for the supply and installation of all MEP services including HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, and Lighting.\n\n## Referenced Malls\n\nWhile the search results mention that major malls like Ikeja City Mall, Jabi Lake Mall, and The Palms were developed by Actis (a different organization), the search results don't provide specific evidence that MAR&MOR Engineering directly worked on these three specific projects. The results confirm these are significant retail developments in Nigeria, but the direct connection to MAR&MOR's portfolio for these particular projects is not explicitly stated in the available search results.\n\nFor more detailed information about MAR&MOR's complete portfolio, I recommend visiting their official website directly at marandmor.com.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"726deb95-fabf-4867-a3bc-586f0eeb3cfc","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:13:51.281Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"37c12d7c-4a79-4d03-95de-16cc5deaa00b"}

Design, procurement, installation, and maintenance of:\n- HVAC systems\n- Power supply & electrical networks\n- Fire fighting & water supply systems\n- Water treatment & sewage treatment\n- Building automation (Siemens partner)\n- ELV (Extra Low Voltage) systems\n- Audio, networking, access control, CCTV\n\n**Market claim:** \"Trusted by more than 50% of Nigeria's malls.\" 80+ completed projects.\n\n**Key differentiator:** Siemens African Partner of the Year — West Africa (2017/2018). They sell and install Siemens Desigo room automation. This means they spec building control systems = they influence what equipment goes into buildings.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Projects (potential triggers)\n\n### 1. Blackbell Mall, Ikota (Lagos)\n- **Status:** Recently completed\n- **Scope:** Full MEP — HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Lighting, Fire Safety, Water Treatment, ELV, Sewage Treatment\n- **Building:** 3-floor commercial mall. Tenants include Blackbell Restaurant, Filmhouse\n- **Trigger strength:** LOW (completed = no active procurement)\n- **Value:** Proves they handle full mall MEP including electrical/power systems\n\n### 2. The Phoenix Office Building, Ikeja (Lagos)\n- **Status:** Completed\n- **Scope:** Full MEP for A-Class 10-story office building (7 office floors + 2 parking + penthouse)\n- **Owner:** Simpatico Ltd\n- **Location:** Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Ikeja\n- **Trigger strength:** LOW (completed)\n- **Value:** Proves high-end commercial office capability. 10-story building = serious backup power requirement\n\n### 3. UN Office Building, Diamniadio (Senegal)\n- **Status:** Completed / Inaugurated Nov 2023\n- **Scope:** MEP services for UN regional headquarters\n- **Building:** Houses 34 UN agencies. Circular design with 7 radiant wings. Eco-responsible, state-of-the-art technology\n- **Key actors:** Macky Sall (opened it), RMA Construction (main contractor)\n- **Trigger strength:** LOW (completed, in Senegal not Nigeria)\n- **Value:** MASSIVE credibility signal. UN project = international-grade spec. Shows they can handle critical infrastructure\n\n### 4. Alliance Place (Lagos)\n- **Status:** In portfolio (details limited)\n- **Trigger strength:** UNKNOWN — needs more intel\n- **Value:** Another Lagos commercial project\n\n### 5. MAR&MOR Lagos Office (Opebi, Ikeja)\n- **Status:** In portfolio — own office outfitted as showcase\n- **Trigger strength:** N/A\n\n### 6. **ACTIVE HIRING: Project Manager in Asaba**\n- **Status:** ACTIVE recruitment signal\n- **Role:** Project Manager, 6-10 years MEP experience, COREN + NSE required\n- **Location:** Asaba, Delta State\n- **Contact for applications:** recruitment@marandmor.com\n- **TRIGGER STRENGTH: HIGH** — Hiring a PM in Asaba = they have a new project in Delta State. MEP PMs don't get hired without a project to manage. Asaba is NOT their existing office territory (Abuja/Lagos). This is expansion.\n\n### 7. Active LinkedIn Hiring Posts\n- Recruiting ELV Engineers, CAD Engineers (electrical + mechanical), Project Managers\n- LinkedIn post (activity-7288589162222379008): \"Join Our Team!\" with MEPF hashtags\n- **TRIGGER STRENGTH: MEDIUM-HIGH** — Multiple simultaneous hires = either expanding or staffing new projects\n\n---\n\n## Power/Generator Connection\n\n**Direct mentions:** None found in public search results. MAR&MOR does not publicly advertise generator supply as a standalone service.\n\n**Implicit connection (STRONG):**\n- Their service list explicitly includes \"power supply, electrical network\" as core services\n- Every mall they outfit needs backup power (Nigeria's grid reality)\n- As MEPF contractor, they SPECIFY what generators go into buildings\n- The Phoenix (10-story office) and Blackbell Mall would both require substantial genset capacity\n- Siemens building automation integration = they're involved in power management systems\n- Their Blackbell Mall scope included \"Electrical\" — which in Nigerian commercial buildings always includes backup power\n\n**The real angle:** MAR&MOR doesn't buy generators directly — they SPECIFY them for their clients. They write the MEP spec that says \"Building requires 500kVA diesel generator with ATS.\" Then the client or main contractor procures. Getting Mikano into MAR&MOR's approved spec library = every future mall/office they design includes Mikano as recommended supplier.\n\n**Estimated generator specs per project type they handle:**\n- Small mall (Blackbell-size, 3 floors): 250kVA-500kVA\n- Large mall (50%+ of Nigeria's malls claim): 500kVA-2MVA\n- A-Class office (Phoenix-size, 10 floors): 500kVA-1MVA\n- UN-grade infrastructure: 1MVA+\n\n---\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Background | Approach Notes |\n|------|-------|-----------|----------------|\n| **Adegboyega \"Gboyega\" Amao** | CEO / Founder | B.Eng Mechanical (LAUTECH), trainings at Lagos Business School, Stanford GSB, Harvard Law, LSE.

As the MEP firm that specs electrical systems for 50%+ of Nigeria's malls, getting Mikano into their approved vendor/spec library means every future mall and commercial building they design becomes a potential Mikano generator sale. The Asaba expansion is the immediate trigger — new territory = new MEP specs being written NOW.\"\n\n**The person to approach first is Kazeem Lasisi (COO, Director of Projects)** because he manages the full project portfolio and decides which equipment standards apply across projects. His ASHRAE + NFPA memberships signal he takes international technical standards seriously, and his Sheffield UK engineering degree suggests he values quality over lowest bid.\n\n**Secondary approach: Ademola Abideen (Director, Technical Services / formerly BD)** because as an Electrical & Electronics engineer now in Technical Services, he directly influences what goes into MEP specifications. If he retained any BD function, he also handles vendor partnerships.\n\n**Tertiary (intelligence gathering): Azeem Bashorun (Head, Design Estimation & Consulting)** because design estimators are the ones who actually write \"500kVA Mikano MTU\" into spec documents.\n\n**Approach angle:** Don't sell generators. Position Mikano as a technical partner for their MEP specs:\n- \"We support MEP firms with generator sizing, load calculations, and ATS integration specs\"\n- \"For your Asaba project, we can do a complimentary power audit\"\n- \"Other MEP firms in Nigeria use our technical team for spec support — saves your engineers time\"\n\n**NODE multiplier:** If MAR&MOR specs Mikano on just 5 projects per year (conservative given 80+ completed), at an average of 500kVA per project, that's 5 generator sales per year from ONE relationship. At ₦60M-₦100M per unit, that's ₦300M-₦500M annual pipeline from one node.\n\n---\n\n## Score (research rubric quick assessment)\n\n| Criteria | Score | Rationale |\n|----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Company relevance** | 9/10 | MEPF firm = directly specifies generators. \"50% of Nigeria's malls\" claim = massive volume. $28.8M revenue = substantial. |\n| **Trigger strength** | 7/10 | Asaba hiring = active new project. Multiple job openings = growth phase. No specific \"we just won X mall\" announcement found, but hiring pattern strongly suggests pipeline. Deducted 3 because completed projects (Blackbell, Phoenix, UN) are past tense — we need current/upcoming projects. |\n| **Node value** | 10/10 | This is a textbook NODE. They don't buy generators — they SPECIFY them for dozens of clients. One relationship = pipeline multiplier of 5-10x. Siemens partnership proves they already work this way (OEM partner model). If Mikano became their \"generator partner\" the way Siemens is their \"automation partner,\" this is the single highest-value node in the pipeline. |\n\n**Overall: 26/30 — PRIORITY NODE. Pursue immediately.**\n\n**Classification:** NODE (not DIRECT — they influence spec, don't procure themselves)\n**Product fit:** DIESEL (malls need diesel backup; gas unlikely for commercial buildings)\n**Recommended stage:** P0 → P1 (research done, ready to make contact)\n**Tier:** A\n\n---\n\n## Next Actions\n\n1. **Find Kazeem Lasisi on LinkedIn** — Check if connected. If not, send connection request with MEP-focused note.\n2. **Research the Asaba project** — What's being built in Asaba that needs a PM? Delta State malls/offices = potential trigger.\n3. **Check Ademola Abideen on LinkedIn** — His title change (BD → Technical Services) is interesting. He may be the technical gatekeeper now.\n4. **Monitor @marandmor_eng on Instagram** — They post project photos. Any new project posts = trigger intel.\n5. **Add to contact cache** after first contact is made.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [MAR&MOR Website](https://marandmor.com/)\n- [MAR&MOR Team Page](https://marandmor.com/about/our-team/)\n- [MAR&MOR About Page](https://marandmor.com/about/)\n- [MAR&MOR LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/mar&mor-integrated-services-ltd)\n- [Blackbell Mall Project](https://marandmor.com/blackbell-mall/)\n- [Phoenix Office Building](https://marandmor.com/phoenix-2/)\n- [UN Office Building](https://marandmor.com/un-office-building/)\n- [Alliance Place](https://marandmor.com/alliance-place/)\n- [Siemens Desigo Page](https://www.marandmor.com/product/siemens-desigo-room-automation/)\n- [ZoomInfo Company Profile](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/mar-and-mor-engineering-services-ltd/369984887)\n- [ZoomInfo Employee Directory](https://www.zoominfo.com/pic/mar-and-mor-engineering-services-ltd/369984887)\n- [Gboyega Amao Bio](https://marandmor.com/person/gboyega-amao)\n- [Kazeem Lasisi Bio](https://www.marandmor.com/team/kazeem-lasisi/)\n- [PM Job Posting — Asaba](https://grabjobs.co/nigeria/job/full-time/engineering-technicians/project-manager-job-at-mar-and-mor-9574960)\n- [MyJobMag Listings](https://www.myjobmag.com/jobs-at/mar-and-mor-integarted-services)\n- [LinkedIn Job Post — MEP Project Engineer Abuja](https://ng.linkedin.com/jobs/view/mep-project-engineer-at-mar-mor-engineering-services-ltd-4279889549)\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marandmor_eng/)\n- [RocketReach Profile](https://rocketreach.co/marmor-engineering-services-ltd-profile_b5eadb89f42e7aec)\n- [UN House Senegal Inauguration](https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/inauguration-united-nations-house-senegal-renewed-commitment-multilateralism-and)\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":736,"cache_read_input_tokens":55590,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":736},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4Q8dPyUxhTZBPcdq5dL","type":"assistant","uuid":"52fa30af-b291-4419-8e24-f3ad6b995685","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:21:11.981Z"}

Here is the summary:\n\n---\n\n## MAR&MOR Engineering — Trigger Research Complete\n\n**Saved to:** `/Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/trellomcp/trello-mcp/projects/mikano/02-Diesel-First/Lead-Generation/marmor-trigger-research.md`\n\n### Key Findings\n\n**Company:** $28.8M revenue, ~184-191 employees, offices in Abuja + Lagos + Dakar (Senegal). Founded 2009 by Adegboyega Amao (Mechanical Engineer, Stanford/Harvard/LSE trained). ISO 9001 + ISO 45001 certified. COREN registered. Claims 80+ completed projects and MEP services for 50%+ of Nigeria's malls.\n\n**The big signal — Siemens Partnership:** MAR&MOR is Siemens' African Partner of the Year (West Africa, 2017/2018). They sell and install Siemens Desigo building automation. This proves they already operate the OEM partner model — they recommend Siemens to their clients. If Mikano can replicate this relationship for generators, it is the same business model.\n\n**Active Trigger — Asaba Hiring:** They are hiring a Project Manager in Asaba, Delta State. This is NOT their normal territory (Abuja/Lagos). Hiring a PM outside your base offices = new project. Also recruiting ELV Engineers, CAD Engineers (electrical + mechanical), and additional PMs simultaneously. Growth signal.\n\n**Known Projects:**\n- Blackbell Mall, Ikota (completed — full MEP)\n- The Phoenix, 10-story office, Ikeja (completed)\n- UN Office Building, Diamniadio, Senegal (completed Nov 2023 — houses 34 UN agencies)\n- Alliance Place, Lagos (in portfolio)\n\n**Primary contact target:** **Kazeem Lasisi, COO / Director of Projects** — manages the full project portfolio. Mechanical engineer (LAUTECH + Sheffield Hallam UK). ASHRAE + NFPA + COREN member. Has been with MAR&MOR since 2013 managing billion-naira portfolios. He decides what equipment standards apply across projects.\n\n**Score: 26/30 — PRIORITY NODE**\n- Company relevance: 9/10\n- Trigger strength: 7/10\n- Node value: 10/10\n\n**Node multiplier math:** If MAR&MOR specs Mikano on just 5 projects/year at ~500kVA average, that is 5 generator sales worth N300M-N500M annually from one relationship.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [MAR&MOR Website](https://marandmor.com/)\n- [MAR&MOR Team Page](https://marandmor.com/about/our-team/)\n- [MAR&MOR LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/mar&mor-integrated-services-ltd)\n- [ZoomInfo Company Profile](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/mar-and-mor-engineering-services-ltd/369984887)\n- [Kazeem Lasisi Bio](https://www.marandmor.com/team/kazeem-lasisi/)\n- [PM Job Posting Asaba](https://grabjobs.co/nigeria/job/full-time/engineering-technicians/project-manager-job-at-mar-and-mor-9574960)\n- [Siemens Desigo Page](https://www.marandmor.com/product/siemens-desigo-room-automation/)\n- [UN House Inauguration](https://unsdg.un.org/latest/stories/inauguration-united-nations-house-senegal-renewed-commitment-multilateralism-and)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4733,"cache_read_input_tokens":56326,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4733},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4QH3mQYBEFqQcEdXxw6","type":"assistant","uuid":"66251787-1657-45f8-bb21-692d298100d1","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:21:28.810Z"}
