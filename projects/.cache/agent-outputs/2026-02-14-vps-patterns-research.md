Some practical examples include:\n\n- **Backups**: Critical backups — n8n workflows, Docker configs, environment samples, Markdown docs — are encrypted and uploaded automatically every day via a cronjob\n- **Git synchronization**: Every push now happens automatically from cron and includes a timestamped commit for traceability\n- **Health monitoring**: AI assistants can run scheduled tasks via cron\n\n## Automation Tools for Hetzner\n\nhcloud-tg is a Telegram bot for managing Hetzner cloud servers, and there are web applications to manage multiple Hetzner Cloud servers from a single interface, built with Python, Flask, and Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Common Issues to Watch For\n\nWhen setting up cron jobs on Hetzner VPS, ensure:\n- Put `#!/usr/bin/sh` to the first line of your script\n- You have the execute bit properly set for the script, run it with a proper user, ensure commands are in PATH, and use proper crontab format\n- Be aware that Cloudflare Bot Fight Mode may block cron jobs from Hetzner VPS\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3b6316b7-f2f3-4e0a-bc8c-845d001d47a4","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:04:45.035Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"1525dbeb-cfc0-4401-9a1b-b150591fb889"}

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Deployment & Automation Platforms\n\nCapRover is a lightweight, self-hosted platform-as-a-service that uses Docker under the hood and is easy to set up on a single VPS with a web-based dashboard and one-command deploys. Coolify stands out with seamless Git integration for automated, push-to-deploy workflows, automated SSL certificates, and instant pull request deployments.\n\n## Development Tools & Coding Assistance\n\nTools like Continue.dev or Cline allow you to connect your local Ollama server directly to VS Code for autocomplete and \"Chat with Codebase\" features powered by Qwen 2.5 Coder, completely offline and zero-latency.\n\n## CI/CD and Code Quality\n\nJenkins is an open-source automation server for the CI/CD process that you can self-host for software projects, offering more customization opportunities.\n\n## Workflow Automation\n\nn8n empowers technical users to automate tasks such as lead generation, AI-driven customer insights, and data monitoring, with the self-hosted Community Edition being free and unlimited.\n\n## General Recommendations\n\nFor solo developers, locally hosting tools is fine, but for teams or continuous use, a VPS will offer better performance. Consider your technical confidence, readiness to handle updates and backups, hardware or VPS resources, compliance needs, and willingness to manage privacy and security directly, as self-hosting eliminates SaaS bills but often requires more involvement in server management.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"66dd7151-5898-4019-8820-681f5ae3749f","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:04:45.995Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"cef18118-aa52-4257-bc68-6e6f40d6ddda"}

Coolify may require more resources due to its GUI, while Dokku is the lightest and cheapest in terms of resource usage.\n\n**Community & Support:**\nCoolify has a very active Discord with fast GitHub issue responses and sponsored development, CapRover has moderate community support via GitHub, while Dokku has a large, established community with excellent documentation and an active Slack channel.\n\n## Recommendation for Solo Developers\n\nFor most people, Coolify is the best choice in 2026 as it's the most feature-rich, actively developed, and beginner-friendly. While it uses more resources, a 4 GB VPS provides plenty of room, and the Docker Compose support is the real differentiator.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c9eeef43-44f8-4d47-9154-94b2fa9a5c49","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:01.508Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"72ffcbc9-c2fb-48dc-80bc-50bb5a79cea3"}

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Webhook Relay Tools for Local Development\n\n**Popular Solutions:**\n\n1. **Tunnelmole** - Creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to your local machine, and when a request hits your public Tunnelmole URL, it's instantly forwarded through the tunnel to your local server. One of the key advantages of Tunnelmole is that it's open source.\n\n2. **DHOOK** - A lightweight, self-hosted webhook relay service designed for developers that forwards webhooks from cloud to your local development environment in real-time.\n\n3. **ngrok** - A tool that allows you to create a secure public URL and forward incoming traffic to your local machine.\n\n4. **Pinggy** - A tool that gives your local server a public URL with just one command, designed for testing Telegram bot webhooks locally.\n\n## VPS and Server Considerations\n\nThere are quite a few VPS/Web hosting providers around the internet, and Telegram currently supports ports 443, 80, 88 and 8443 for webhooks.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThese webhook relay solutions are particularly useful for developers building applications that integrate with external services like GitHub, Stripe, PayMe, or Telegram, who often need to receive webhooks during development.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8616d490-9c3d-45b6-bd7f-bae01a3b4277","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:12.228Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"c7d5b0c7-6a64-4488-86fa-29960eb898ea"}

Instead of polling on a schedule, systems can push events when something happens, and n8n catches those events via webhooks to trigger workflows instantly.\n\n## Server Monitoring Use Case\n\nA practical example involves monitoring server uptime with UptimeRobot—if downtime is detected, n8n can automatically run a shell command to attempt recovery, then send real-time notifications to your team via Slack, WhatsApp, or Discord.\n\n## Web Scraping & Monitoring\n\nSolo developers are running self-hosted n8n solutions that can monitor websites and scrape data, which is then processed through n8n.\n\n## VPS Deployment for Solo Developers\n\nn8n can be installed on VPS infrastructure to create a powerful and private automation engine, unlocking flexibility, security, and cost-effectiveness. When self-hosting n8n, there are no software-imposed limits on workflows, steps, or executions—your only recurring cost is the server infrastructure itself.\n\n## Real-World Workflow Example: GitHub Deployments\n\nA workflow can listen for GitHub deployment events and send Slack notifications, replacing what would otherwise require a custom script, a cron job to check deployment status, and manual notification logic.\n\n## Cron Job Monitoring\n\nTo get notified when scheduled workflows stop running, you can use Healthchecks.io by adding an HTTP node to your Schedule (Cron/Interval) Trigger node. Alternatives include cronitor.io and uptimerobot.com.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e7fd3fc7-bd89-4e8d-814a-f52b8e7e8460","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:16.453Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"569cd1c4-a4ab-4c4f-b6a7-bd4bade93fc3"}

It is often described as simpler than Traefik and many like it better.\n\n## Simple Configuration\n\nCaddy configs are human-friendly and you can get a site online with just a few lines. As a comparison, Nginx can require dozens of lines of configuration for a single host rule.\n\n## Automatic HTTPS\n\nCaddy securely serves all sites with TLS by default. Caddy automatically requests and renews free SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt for domains it serves.\n\n## Docker Integration\n\nIn order for caddy to see your other services they all need to be on the same network, either by putting them all in the same docker-compose file or setting up an external network that they all share. A Caddy Docker Proxy plugin enables Caddy to be used as a reverse proxy for Docker containers via labels, and the plugin scans Docker metadata looking for labels indicating which service or container should be served by Caddy.\n\n## Multi-Service Routing\n\nPath-based routing with Caddy reverse proxy allows you to host multiple services on a single domain, where different paths are proxied to different backend applications. Additionally, Caddy can reverse proxy multiple domains, subdomains, or even different paths on the same domain to different backend applications.\n\nThis setup is particularly well-suited for solo developers managing multiple services on a single VPS instance.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"bdc067c6-25e6-468f-a0b5-7783b49f36ae","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:28.561Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8f1443de-9fe5-41db-a493-0ce3663c1ccb"}

Self-hosted runners give solo developers fine-tuning performance and control that cloud runners never could.\n\n## VPS Setup Options\n\nOne straightforward way to host GitHub Actions runners is using Amazon EC2 instances, with an instance having 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM (e.g., t3.medium) being a good starting point. Additionally, this should also work on a VPS.\n\n## Why Self-Hosted Runners for Solo Developers\n\nA solo developer maintaining a Python API may install dependencies like TensorFlow and CUDA on the runner — something GitHub-hosted runners can't do efficiently. Running your own infrastructure might make sense for security and compliance requirements, the need for specialized hardware or software that GitHub-hosted runners don't support, custom networking setups, and to optimize costs especially when running high-volume workloads.\n\n## Cost Considerations (2025-2026)\n\nImportant update: Currently (as of December 17, 2025): Self-hosted runners are completely free with no per-minute charges at all—you only pay for your own infrastructure (e.g., your VM costs on AWS/Azure/on-prem). However, starting March 1, 2026: GitHub introduces a new $0.002 per minute \"Actions cloud platform\" charge for self-hosted runner usage in private/internal repositories.\n\n## Managed Alternatives\n\nIf you prefer not to manage your own runners, RunsOn gives you the same ephemeral runner experience but at 90% lower cost, with faster performance, running entirely in your AWS account, and is a managed solution that deploys with one click and requires zero maintenance.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d7b2f56a-57a4-4fca-b867-4546b534296d","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:29.722Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"34b39f35-f8f4-49e3-a081-471c50ce88c7"}

Miniflux is meant to be a minimal RSS reader yet still has great features that compare to other self-hosted feed readers.\n\nMiniflux is a twelve-factor app, ready to be used in a container environment, and publishes container images on both DockerHub and the GitHub container registry. However, Miniflux requires a PostgreSQL database, which may isn't suitable for a tiny VPS instance.\n\n## ChangeDetection.io\n\nChangeDetection.io is a web service that pings a list of URLs and lets you know if there are valuable updates to content. Self-hosting on a VPS or dedicated server is pretty straightforward, especially with Docker.\n\nRSS was the best way to stay updated on everything, and it's back with changedetection.io's RSS Reader Mode. Additionally, by running ChangeDetection.io on your Raspberry Pi, you can monitor as many sites as you like and receive notifications through services such as Discord, email, Slack, and Telegram.\n\n## For Solo Developers\n\nFor developers looking to self-host on small VPS instances, one developer built an alternative with Golang and SQLite specifically because Miniflux requires a PostgreSQL database, which isn't suitable for a tiny VPS instance.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"dbaa2382-da34-4f56-a9ff-309cb7949708","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:30.427Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"0bb4d853-b912-4957-9966-7516f6413732"}

Jenkins is an open-source automation server for the CI/CD process that developers self-host for software projects.\n\n## Media & Storage\n\nJellyfin has definitively won the media server wars, as Plex's increasingly aggressive monetization pushed users toward this fully open-source alternative. Immich's growth has been remarkable, with self-hosters tired of training Google's AI with their family photos finding a genuine alternative that includes machine learning features without the privacy compromise.\n\n## Productivity & Collaboration\n\nNextcloud remains the productivity backbone for most homelabs. Rocket.Chat is considered the best free, open source, Slack alternative in 2026.\n\n## Security & Privacy\n\nWireGuard replaced OpenVPN as the standard for accessing home services remotely, with the speed difference being noticeable and configuration dramatically simpler. Developers can self-host Bitwarden via their open source server implementation, a lightweight alternative that provides core password manager features.\n\n## Infrastructure & AI\n\nOllama has made running local language models trivially easy, with a used office PC with 32GB RAM capable of running 7B-13B parameter models. Nginx Proxy Manager remains popular for beginners with its friendly UI, while experienced homelabbers often use Caddy for its automatic HTTPS and simple configuration.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5d450644-619f-45ce-b20c-e4d9dd3589a9","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:30.828Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"77155e8c-fc1d-4876-aae6-3847b5aacb30"}

Built with Go, PocketBase offers a self-hosted alternative to Supabase that's ideal for projects that demand full control over infrastructure.\n\n## Key Features\n\nPocketBase ships as a single executable that includes the database, auth system, file storage, and admin dashboard, all in about 15MB. SQLite is embedded in the binary, so there's no separate database server or multiple services to manage.\n\nThis setup works well for MVPs, internal tools, and edge applications. Custom logic can be added through Go hooks, keeping it extendable while staying lightweight.\n\n## Pricing and Hosting\n\nPocketBase is free. You only pay for hosting - VPS, cloud VM, or on-prem hardware. A $5 VPS is sufficient for small to medium applications, making it low-cost for lightweight projects.\n\n## Advantages for Solo Developers\n\nOne binary file is all you need to get started. It's fully self-hosted, giving you total control over your backend. It's lightweight & blazing fast, making it ideal for edge deployments, prototypes, and hobby apps.\n\nPocketBase is a single Go binary with SQLite, which keeps it lightweight for small apps and prototypes.\n\n## Limitations\n\nIt lacks scalability for large, production-scale applications. It has no built-in role-based access control (RBAC). It has limited third-party integration and ecosystem support.\n\n## Comparison to Supabase\n\nSupabase and PocketBase both provide auth, a database, and APIs you can run yourself, but they take very different approaches. Supabase uses PostgreSQL and works for structured data and scalable applications. PocketBase is a single Go binary with SQLite, which keeps it lightweight for small apps and prototypes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"598ca1b4-da50-4bb9-8be4-bbae2de313d3","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:42.368Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"453cf305-3c5a-4025-9006-796c77793c2c"}

The transcription and summarization are powered by OpenAI's Whisper API and ChatGPT respectively.\n\nThere's also a self-hosted Telegram bot that can transcribe voice messages and provide summaries using OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-4 models.\n\n## Self-Hosted Local Solutions\n\nFor privacy-focused self-hosting, voice messages can be transcribed into text using Whisper running locally on your Raspberry Pi. The transcribed note can be sent to LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama for summarization and metadata extraction, with notes stored in a local database like SQLite or JSON.\n\n## No-Code Workflow Platforms\n\nN8n workflows can route transcripts into Notion, Airtable, or CRM systems. Additionally, voice messages can be transcribed automatically using Whisper via Groq, with only the extracted text kept for further processing.\n\n## Speech Recognition Libraries\n\nTelegram bots can be built on the aiogram and openAI-Whisper libraries for efficient code, supporting offline transcription capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"df3fe737-9e2b-4f03-86ec-abffe0b64db4","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:42.609Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ba609bdd-a0a4-4225-a3ce-46b79aa053c6"}

Temporal is a powerful open‑source engine for orchestrating complex, stateful workflows, especially long‑running microservices and event‑driven pipelines, with resilient worker processes and durable execution.\n\n## Self-Hosted Deployment Options\n\nTeams seeking more control can deploy self-hosted Temporal clusters on platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, or Kubernetes. The Temporal Server is open-source software written in Go that can be self-hosted or used as a platform-as-a-service in the Temporal Cloud. The user is responsible for running enough workers, which can be any long-lived compute nodes: VMs, containers, Kubernetes pods, etc.\n\n## Lightweight Alternatives\n\nFor teams seeking simpler alternatives, there are several options:\n\n- **Prefect**: Prefect is a Python-native workflow platform highly effective for AI agents that require dynamic loops, conditional logic, and responsiveness, where you define workflows as regular Python functions with @flow and @task, and Prefect handles orchestration, retries, and scheduling in the background.\n\n- **Cadence**: Cadence offers lighter-weight, easier-to-adopt alternatives with quicker developer onboarding and reduced cognitive load.\n\n- **Inngest**: Inngest is an event-driven durable workflow platform that replaces traditional queues, state management, and scheduling with durable functions that automatically handle retries, concurrency, and orchestration without infrastructure overhead.\n\n- **DBOS**: DBOS is a database-oriented platform that implements durable execution by storing all application state and workflow progress directly in a database, eliminating traditional orchestration layers by making the database the core component for state management and workflow coordination.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"71d17100-1079-415e-8400-832ff36370ef","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:05:58.389Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"51209152-a815-41ae-ac7d-d20f490c6852"}

A minimum 2GB RAM handles basic chat; browser automation requires 4GB or more.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nUsers have built integrations like voice message transcription systems and recipe-to-shopping-cart automation, demonstrating the platform's extensibility through its skills marketplace."}]},"uuid":"61432fb4-40fd-4f4b-9310-6807e78bd04f","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:06:39.125Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"ea198a9a-8697-44fe-9ea0-a8c70748a5dc"}

It \"decides whether the content belongs to an existing article or should start a new one,\" updating articles incrementally rather than regenerating them completely.\n\n**Versioning:**\n\"All changes are committed to a GitHub repository. Each processing run results in a concrete diff that shows exactly what changed.\" The bot sends commit links back to Telegram.\n\n## Key Technical Capabilities\n\n1. **Voice Transcription**: Whisper via Groq automatically transcribes voice messages; audio files are then removed\n2. **Image Processing**: Groq Vision describes images, which are organized under `assets/images/{article_name}/`\n3. **Multilingual Support**: Content recorded in Russian is translated to English during processing\n4. **Link Integration**: External URLs are fetched and summarized, then incorporated into relevant articles\n5. **Git Orchestration**: The agent can follow natural-language instructions like running `git pull` before pushing updates\n\n## Development Approach\n\nGrigorev first refined his vision through ChatGPT conversations, documenting requirements in a system specification. He then asked Claude Code to implement the system following that specification, creating a working prototype he could immediately test within his own workflow."}]},"uuid":"bfd0551e-6bda-4892-ae7c-7fb726c220d5","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:06:52.138Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f428afb7-e3f8-4bdf-8df6-d9de2e37272a"}

Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n## Inngest Overview\n\nInngest is an event-driven durable workflow platform that replaces traditional queues, state management, and scheduling with durable functions that automatically handle retries, concurrency, and orchestration without infrastructure overhead.\n\n## Key Characteristics for Self-Hosted & Lightweight Deployments\n\nInngest runs on servers or serverless environments with no stateful backend to manage, and seamlessly scales on AWS Lambda and Cloudflare Workers, or your own containers. Self-hosting the Inngest server is possible and easy to get started with.\n\n## How Inngest Works vs Temporal\n\nInngest invokes functions through secure HTTP calls, managing the entire durable execution and queueing system as a service without requiring you to manage the orchestration engine's uptime. In contrast, Temporal offers fine-tuned control through a self-hosted or managed cluster for enterprises that need to orchestrate mission-critical processes with absolute certainty.\n\n## Long-Running Bot Workflows\n\nSteps are fundamental building blocks of Inngest, turning Inngest Functions into reliable workflows that can run for months and recover from failures.\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nInngest uses native language primitives for direct execution, making debugging simpler compared to Temporal's approach. Additionally, Inngest can run anywhere (edge, serverless, traditional), from any trigger (API calls, webhooks, schedules), on any code (agents, endpoints, cron).\n\nThe search results show that Inngest is positioned as a more lightweight, developer-friendly alternative to Temporal, particularly suited for self-hosted lightweight VPS deployments with minimal infrastructure overhead.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3e5f6258-0fbe-4158-9cd2-bbe33d17d867","timestamp":"2026-02-14T19:06:52.739Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"54ec4233-21af-4bc1-a559-38d37a6c855b"}

Let me write it up.\n\n---\n\n# Hetzner VPS (4GB/2CPU) -- Leverage Patterns for Solo Builders\n\nResearch drawn from GitHub repos, Hacker News threads, self-hosting blogs, and real builder setups. Everything below fits within 4GB RAM unless noted otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## 1. ALWAYS-ON BOTS & AGENTS\n\n### Telegram Capture Bot (Voice + Text + Links --> Structured Output)\n**What:** A Telegram bot that receives brain dumps (voice notes, text, links, images) from your phone and processes them into structured markdown, then commits to GitHub or pushes to Notion.\n**Why it creates leverage:** Your phone becomes a capture device that feeds directly into your laptop work sessions. No context switching. Send a voice note while walking, pick it up as structured text in your next session.\n**Resource needs:** ~100-200MB RAM. Whisper transcription via Groq API (free tier) keeps it off-box.\n**Key repos/tools:**\n- [telegram-notion-notes](https://github.com/Shreyaan/telegram-notion-notes) -- Node.js, Whisper + GPT --> Notion database\n- [Hyena](https://github.com/konfortes/hyena) -- Python, voice --> AWS Transcribe --> Notion GTD inbox\n- [telegram-voice-message-summary-bot](https://github.com/benjamingjw/telegram-voice-message-summary-bot) -- Whisper + GPT-4 summarization\n- [Alexey Grigorev's brain dump bot](https://alexeyondata.substack.com/p/telegram-assistant) -- Claude-powered, captures voice/text/links/images, auto-organizes into markdown articles, commits diffs to GitHub with links sent back to Telegram. **This is the closest to your capture net pattern.**\n\n### ClawdBot (Self-Hosted AI Assistant in Messaging Apps)\n**What:** A self-hosted AI assistant that lives inside Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord. Has persistent memory, proactive alerts (briefings, reminders), and can browse the web and fill forms autonomously.\n**Why it creates leverage:** It is the \"always-on agent\" pattern. Set up stock alerts, weather warnings, calendar prep, research tasks. It initiates contact with YOU, not the other way around.\n**Resource needs:** 2GB minimum for chat, 4GB for browser automation. Fits your box.\n**Reference:** [ClawdBot writeup](https://velvetshark.com/clawdbot-the-self-hosted-ai-that-siri-should-have-been) -- runs on a $5/month Hetzner VPS. Components: Gateway (messaging connections) + Agent (Claude/GPT) + Skills (extensible) + Memory (persistent context).\n\n### Cottontail (Telegram + GPT + Custom Tools)\n**What:** Self-hosted Telegram bot that integrates GPT with custom external tools you define.\n**Why it creates leverage:** You can wire up your own tool functions (check server status, query databases, trigger deployments) and invoke them via Telegram chat.\n**Resource needs:** Minimal (~50-100MB).\n**Repo:** [cottontail](https://github.com/thevinter/cottontail)\n\n### Client-Facing Bots (Your Product)\n**What:** The conversational AI products you build for clients (training bots, intake bots, assessment engines).\n**Why it creates leverage:** Your VPS becomes the staging/production runtime for client demos and live bots. \"I'll send you a bot\" -- that bot lives here.\n**Resource needs:** Depends on framework, but a Python/Node bot with webhook mode uses ~100-300MB per bot. You can run 5-10 lightweight bots on 4GB.\n**Pattern:** Use webhook mode (not polling) for production bots. Caddy handles SSL and routing per subdomain.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CRON JOBS & AUTOMATION\n\n### n8n (Self-Hosted Workflow Automation)\n**What:** Open-source Zapier/Make alternative with visual workflow builder. 400+ integrations.

No manual SSH-and-restart cycles. Docker Compose support means you deploy entire stacks (bot + database + monitoring) in one push.\n**Resource needs:** ~300-500MB for Coolify itself. Leaves ~3GB for your apps.\n**Why Coolify over Dokku/CapRover:** Best Docker Compose support, most active development, modern UI. [Comparison source](https://cybersnowden.com/coolify-vs-dokku-vs-caprover-self-hosted-platform/).\n\n### Caddy (Reverse Proxy + Auto-SSL)\n**What:** Single binary that routes traffic to your Docker services and automatically manages HTTPS certificates.\n**Why it creates leverage:** One VPS, many services. `bot1.yourdomain.com` --> client bot. `n8n.yourdomain.com` --> automation. `status.yourdomain.com` --> monitoring. Zero SSL configuration.\n**Resource needs:** ~20-30MB RAM.\n**Repo:** [caddy-docker-proxy](https://github.com/lucaslorentz/caddy-docker-proxy) -- auto-configures from Docker labels.\n\n### Gitea + Woodpecker CI (Lightweight Git + CI/CD)\n**What:** Self-hosted Git server (Gitea, ~512MB) + lightweight CI runner (Woodpecker) that triggers builds on push/PR.\n**Why it creates leverage:** Private repos for client work without GitHub limits. CI/CD pipelines that deploy to the same VPS. Useful if you want to keep client code off GitHub entirely.\n**Resource needs:** Gitea ~200-500MB, Woodpecker ~200MB. Total ~700MB. Fits on 4GB with room to spare.\n**Repos:** [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) | [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) | [Docker Compose setup](https://codeberg.org/alexruf/docker-compose-woodpecker-ci)\n**Note:** If you use GitHub and are happy with it, skip this. Only worth it for client IP isolation or offline development.\n\n### Webhook Relay (GitHub --> VPS Deployment)\n**What:** GitHub sends a webhook on push --> your VPS pulls and redeploys.\n**Why it creates leverage:** You code on your laptop with Claude Code, push to GitHub, and the VPS auto-deploys. No SSH needed.\n**Resource needs:** Negligible. A 20-line script listening on a port.\n\n---\n\n## 4. DATA COLLECTION & MONITORING\n\n### Uptime Kuma (Status Monitoring)\n**What:** Self-hosted monitoring dashboard. Pings your services (HTTP, TCP, DNS, Docker containers) and alerts you when they go down.\n**Why it creates leverage:** Know when client bots die before clients tell you. Professional status page you can share with clients. \"Here's your uptime dashboard: status.yourdomain.com.\"\n**Resource needs:** ~100-150MB RAM.\n**Repo:** [uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) -- 65k+ stars. The gold standard.\n\n### ntfy (Push Notifications)\n**What:** Self-hosted push notification service. Send alerts from any script via simple HTTP POST. Phone app receives them instantly.\n**Why it creates leverage:** Universal alert pipe. Cron job fails? `curl ntfy.yourdomain.com/alerts -d \"Backup failed\"`. Client bot down? Same.
