Now let me compile the full research output.\n\n---\n\n# Alpha Mead FM -- Trigger Research\n\n## Company Overview\n\n**Alpha Mead Group** is a Total Real Estate Solutions Company founded in 2006 by **Femi Akintunde** (ex-Shell, Nestle, UBA -- 30+ years experience). Headquartered at **6 Mobolaji Johnson Avenue, Ikoyi, Lagos**.\n\n- **6 Strategic Business Units:** AMFacilities, AMDC (Development), AMTC (Training Centre), AMST (Security Systems & Tech), AMHS (Healthcare Management), AMC (Capital)\n- **Employees:** 1,000+ across Africa (LinkedIn says 501-1,000 for the group entity)\n- **Revenue:** ~$476M (RocketReach, 2025 -- likely inflated, but confirms significant scale)\n- **Presence:** Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal, Gambia, South Africa, UAE, 10+ other African countries\n- **ISO 9001:2015** certified by UKAS (UK Accreditation Services)\n- **Awards:** LSEG \"Companies to Inspire Africa\" (2019), NSE/BusinessDay Next Bull Award (2019)\n- **Capital markets access:** Registered **N5 billion Commercial Paper Programme** on FMDQ Exchange (May 2024) -- signals growth financing, expansion appetite\n\n**Group Chairman:** Mutiu Sunmonu (CON) -- former Shell Nigeria MD, heavyweight industry figure\n\n## Power Solutions Division (Key Focus)\n\nAlpha Mead's Power Solutions Services explicitly cover:\n- **Sales** of electric power generating equipment\n- **Rentals** of generators\n- **Leasing** of power equipment\n- **Installation & Commissioning** of generators\n- **Operation & Maintenance** of generating equipment\n- **Logistics support** for generators\n\n**Target segments:** Corporate buildings, events, construction sites, residential estates.\n\nThis is not a peripheral service line -- it is a **named division** within AMFacilities. They manage power infrastructure at every facility they run.\n\n**Concrete proof -- Ado Bayero Mall, Kano:**\n- Alpha Mead manages the integrated FM for this 10-hectare, 24,000 sqm retail complex (Shoprite, Game, FilmHouse Cinemas)\n- The mall runs on **~5,700 KVA of diesel backup generators** -- maintained by Alpha Mead\n- Services include: maintenance of chillers, **generators**, plumbing, elevators, electrical systems\n- This is a LARGE generator fleet at a single site\n\n**Job postings (Aug 2025):**\n- **Generator Technician** -- troubleshooting AC electrical systems on generators, ATS, generator controls, engine-related mechanical failures, spare parts inventory, computerized generator controls\n- **Electrical Technician** -- Ado Bayero Mall, Kano\n- These hiring signals confirm ongoing generator maintenance operations\n\n## Recent Projects/Contracts (Potential Triggers)\n\n| Client | Scope | Notes |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n| **Ecobank Nigeria** | Integrated FM at corporate HQ + Data Centre | Data centres = heavy power/cooling needs |\n| **MTN Nigeria** | Integrated FM across multiple asset portfolios nationwide | Telecom = massive generator fleet |\n| **FCMB** | FM services | \"100% availability of critical equipment at one of the leading commercial banks\" |\n| **Huawei Technologies** | FM services | Tech campus power needs |\n| **Lafarge Africa** | FM services | Cement manufacturing = heavy industrial power |\n| **Nigerian Breweries** | FM services | Manufacturing = continuous power demand |\n| **Access Bank** | FM services | Banking = UPS + generator backup critical |\n| **Nigerian Stock Exchange** | FM at NSE House | Financial infrastructure |\n| **Ado Bayero Mall, Kano** | Full integrated FM | 5,700 KVA generator capacity |\n\n**Financial trigger:** N5 billion Commercial Paper Programme (May 2024) -- they are raising capital for growth. When FM companies grow, their generator fleet grows proportionally.\n\n## Power/Generator Connection\n\nThis is where it gets strong for Mikano:\n\n```\nALPHA MEAD POWER TOUCHPOINTS:\n\n1. DEDICATED Power Solutions Division\n   - Sales, rentals, leasing, installation, commissioning, O&M\n   - NOT a side service -- named service line\n\n2. MASSIVE client portfolio requiring generator backup\n   - Ecobank HQ + Data Centre (always-on power critical)\n   - MTN nationwide assets (telecom towers = gen-dependent)\n   - Ado Bayero Mall (5,700 KVA diesel backup)\n   - Banking clients (FCMB, Access Bank) = zero-downtime power\n\n3. ACTIVE generator technician hiring (Aug 2025)\n   - Troubleshooting generators, ATS, control panels\n   - Spare parts inventory management\n   - Computerized generator controls\n\n4. O&G track record (95% SLA)\n   - Oil & gas = heavy diesel generator usage\n   - \"Zero fatality in 12 years\" across African markets\n\n5. GROWTH financing (N5B commercial paper, May 2024)\n   - Expanding client base = expanding power needs\n   - New facilities = new generator procurement\n```\n\n**Key insight:** Alpha Mead does NOT manufacture generators. They **procure, install, and maintain** them for clients. This makes them either:\n- A **bulk buyer** of generators (DIRECT sale opportunity)\n- A **recommender/specifier** for clients (NODE opportunity -- they influence which brand gets bought for every new contract)\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Source | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Femi Akintunde** | Group MD/CEO | [Alpha Mead Team](https://alphamead.com/team/femi-akintunde-3/index.html), [BusinessYear](https://thebusinessyear.com/interview/femi-akintunde-managing-director-alpha-mead-group/) | Founded 2006. Ex-Shell, Nestle, UBA. 30+ yrs. Fellow IWFM. Too senior for cold outreach -- use for credibility mapping |\n| **Mutiu Sunmonu (CON)** | Group Chairman | [Alpha Mead About](https://alphamead.com/about-us/index.html) | Former Shell Nigeria MD.

Ex-Shell Nigeria, ex-Centrica Resources (Country Manager). Runs the FM subsidiary = controls generator procurement. **PRIMARY TARGET for senior engagement** |\n| **Wale Odufalu** | MD, Alpha Mead Development (prev: GED Corporate Services) | [Alpha Mead](https://alphamead.com/team/wale-odufalu-2/), [ThisDay](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/12/02/alpha-mead-development-appoints-wale-odufalu-as-md/) | Female. FCIS, MBA (OAU). Pioneer Chair of IWFM Nigeria. Appointed AMDC MD in Nov 2021. Was Group ED Corporate -- still has cross-subsidiary influence. **STRONG NODE contact** |\n| **Rotimi Alashe** | Group Executive Director, Finance | [Alpha Mead EMT](https://alphamead.com/executive-management-teamemt/index.html) | Controls budgets. Relevant if pricing/commercial discussion |\n| **Ojelabi Christiana** | Facility Manager / Head Corporate Real Estate & Commercial Facilities | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ojelabi-christiana-70052348/) | On-the-ground FM manager. Would know generator maintenance pain points firsthand. **OPERATIONAL CONTACT for needs assessment** |\n\n## Website Intel\n\n- Website: [alphamead.com](https://alphamead.com/) (note: JS-heavy site, WebFetch couldn't scrape content -- likely React/Next.js)\n- Career portal: [SmartRecruiters](https://careers.smartrecruiters.com/AlphaMeadGroup)\n- Training arm: [alphameadtraining.com](https://alphameadtraining.com/) -- they train FM professionals (potential Mikano co-branding opportunity for generator maintenance training)\n- LinkedIn: [Alpha Mead Group](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/alpha-mead-facilities-and-management-services-ltd)\n\n## Trigger Hypotheses\n\n**Hypothesis 1: BULK PROCUREMENT NODE (Highest Value)**\nAlpha Mead specifies, procures, installs, and maintains generators for ALL their FM clients. Every new FM contract = new generator order. They are a **gateway to Ecobank, MTN, FCMB, Lafarge, Nigerian Breweries, Access Bank** generator needs. One relationship with Alpha Mead = pipeline multiplier across their entire client portfolio.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: REPLACEMENT CYCLE at Ado Bayero Mall**\n5,700 KVA of diesel generators at one facility. These generators have maintenance cycles and eventual replacement timelines. Alpha Mead is actively hiring generator technicians for Kano (Aug 2025). This could signal either fleet expansion or replacement procurement coming.\n\n**Hypothesis 3: GROWTH-DRIVEN PROCUREMENT**\nN5 billion Commercial Paper (May 2024) = expansion capital. Alpha Mead is growing into new facilities. Each new FM contract they win requires generator infrastructure. Their growth = Mikano's growth if positioned as preferred supplier.\n\n**Hypothesis 4: TRAINING PARTNERSHIP**\nAlpha Mead Training Centre trains FM professionals across Africa. Mikano could partner on generator maintenance curriculum -- branding + trust + pipeline. This is a soft-entry angle that builds long-term NODE value.\n\n**Hypothesis 5: MTN TOWER FLEET (Whale Opportunity)**\nAlpha Mead manages MTN's facilities nationwide. Telecom tower backup power is one of the largest generator markets in Nigeria. If Alpha Mead handles MTN's generator O&M, the volume could be enormous.\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\n```\nENTRY STRATEGY:\n\nPrimary target:  Wole Olufore (MD, AMFacilities)\n                 - Ex-Shell, understands procurement\n                 - Controls generator specs for all FM contracts\n                 - Senior enough to make supplier decisions\n\nSecondary:       Ojelabi Christiana (FM Manager)\n                 - Operational pain points\n                 - Knows current generator brands in use\n                 - Lower barrier to connect\n\nNODE play:       Wale Odufalu (MD, AMDC)\n                 - Cross-subsidiary influence\n                 - Pioneer Chair IWFM Nigeria\n                 - Real estate development = new-build generator specs\n\nAngle:           \"We supply generators to FM companies managing\n                  large commercial portfolios. Your Power Solutions\n                  division caught our attention -- curious what brands\n                  you're running at Ado Bayero Mall and your\n                  commercial banking sites.\"\n\nClassification:  NODE (pipeline multiplier across their client base)\nProduct fit:     DIESEL (FM = diesel backup power)\n```\n\n## Score\n\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Company relevance** | **9/10** | Dedicated Power Solutions division. FM company that procures, installs, maintains generators as core service. ISO certified. Fortune 100 African clients. Active generator technician hiring. |\n| **Trigger strength** | **7/10** | N5B commercial paper (growth capital), active generator tech hiring (Aug 2025), expanding into new markets. No single \"just won a huge contract\" trigger, but multiple compounding signals. |\n| **Node value** | **10/10** | This is the definition of a NODE. One relationship unlocks Ecobank, MTN, FCMB, Lafarge, Nigerian Breweries, Access Bank, Huawei, NSE, and every future FM contract they win. The pipeline multiplier is massive. They don't make generators -- they BUY them for clients. |\n\n**Overall: TIER A prospect. NODE class. DIESEL product fit.**\n\n**Comparable to:** StarSight Energy in your pipeline (energy solutions provider that buys generators for clients) -- but Alpha Mead is bigger, has more blue-chip clients, and has a dedicated Power Solutions division.\n\n---\n\nSources (80/20):\n- 40% -- [Alpha Mead About Facilities](https://alphamead.com/about-facilities/) + [Facilities Management Services](https://alphamead.com/facilities-management-services/index.html) (Power Solutions scope, client list, ISO cert)\n- 20% -- [Ado Bayero Mall Kano case study](https://alphamead.com/cases/ado-bayero-mall-kano/) (5,700 KVA generator proof, FM scope)\n- 15% -- [FMDQ Commercial Paper](https://fmdqgroup.com/alpha-mead-facilities-management-services-limited-registers-%E2%82%A65-00-billion-commercial-paper-programme-on-fmdq-exchange/) (N5B growth financing trigger)\n- 10% -- [MyJobMag Generator Technician posting](https://www.myjobmag.com/job/generator-technician-alpha-mead-group-2) (active hiring signal)\n- 10% -- [BusinessDay Wole Olufore interview](https://businessday.ng/interview/article/we-tailor-our-services-to-align-with-clients-scope-of-work-alpha-mead-md/) + [Wale Odufalu appointment](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/12/02/alpha-mead-development-appoints-wale-odufalu-as-md/) (key people intel)\n- 5% -- [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/alpha-mead-group/359144571) + [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/alpha-mead-group-profile_b456ee92fca77fdd) (company size, revenue estimates)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2392,"cache_read_input_tokens":36786,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2392},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4Q5J53rruRioYrFQL1n","type":"assistant","uuid":"4ff6995f-71f8-4a84-bf2d-28e7e9bf500d","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:19:54.434Z"}
