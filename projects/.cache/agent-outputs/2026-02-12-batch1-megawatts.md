Here are the key findings:\n\n## Nigeria's Power Generation Capacity\n\nNigeria has twenty-three (23) power-generating plants connected to the national grid with the capacity to generate 11,165.4 MW of electricity. More recently, Nigeria's electricity sector reached a peak power generation of 5,801.84 megawatts (MW) and a maximum daily energy generation of 128,370.75 megawatt-hours (MWh)—the highest ever attained in the country's history.\n\n## Power Sources and Generation Mix\n\nThe primary source of electricity generation comes from fossil fuels, especially gas, which accounts for 86% of the capacity in Nigeria, with the remainder generated from hydropower sources. Additionally, Nigeria gets about 40,000 megawatts of electricity from generators powered by Premium Motor Spirit and those run by Automotive Gas Oil.\n\n## Types of Power Plants\n\nThere are currently two main types of power plants operating in Nigeria: hydro-electric and thermal or fossil fuel power plants, with thermal power plants (gas-fired plants) dominating at 81 percent of the total installed capacity in early 2014.\n\nThe search results provide information about Nigeria's overall power generation capacity and specifications but don't contain specific details about \"MEP\" generator specifications. If you need more specific information about MEP generator models or other particular generator specifications, please let me know.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1b0525ce-61c0-4a28-9c1a-feb9d59974cc","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:13:38.282Z","sourceToolAssistantUUID":"db8951fa-f539-464f-80bd-114cfbcb06b5"}

Shows long-term institution-building mindset, not just project-to-project survival.\n\n## Recent Projects (potential triggers)\n\n**Estate Intel data:** 9 total projects (2 ongoing, 7 completed).\n\n**Named project:** Proposed 14 Floors Residential Development for Address Homes, Milverton, Ikoyi -- this is a high-end Lagos residential project. Ikoyi = premium real estate. A 14-floor residential tower requires substantial MEP scope including:\n- Backup generator sizing and installation (critical in Lagos)\n- HVAC for all 14 floors\n- Fire protection systems\n- Electrical distribution\n\n**Hiring signal (Nov 2025):** Actively recruiting a Mechanical Project Engineer in Lagos (B.Eng/MSc Mechanical, PMP, 5-6 years experience). Active hiring = active projects = growing backlog.\n\n**Growth trajectory:** The fact they have a dedicated \"Head of Growth and Engineering Market Development\" role (Olatunji) plus an \"Executive Director, Business Development\" (Afam Anyika) plus a \"Senior Business Development Officer\" (Olubukola Ojo) = three-deep BD function. This firm is actively hunting for new projects, not passively waiting.\n\n## Power/Generator Connection\n\n**This is the critical link for Mikano.**\n\nMegawatts Nigeria is an MEP contractor. Here is why this matters for generator sales:\n\n1. **MEP contractors SPECIFY generators in tender documents.** When they design the electrical systems for a building (like the 14-floor Ikoyi tower), they write the backup power specification -- kVA rating, fuel type, redundancy, switchgear, ATS requirements. The developer/client then procures the generator that meets that spec.\n\n2. **MEP contractors are the #1 node gap in the current pipeline** (per `/projects/mikano/02-Diesel-First/Lead-Generation/pipeline.md` line 49: \"MEP engineers = #1 node gap. Zero in pipeline. They write genset specs into tender docs.\")\n\n3. **Each project = one genset spec.** With 2 ongoing and 7 completed projects visible, plus active hiring suggesting more in the pipeline, this firm could be specifying multiple generators per year.\n\n4. **They don't sell generators -- they specify them.** This is a NODE relationship, not DIRECT. They influence what brand goes into the building. If Megawatts specifies \"Mikano 500kVA diesel genset\" in the tender, the developer buys Mikano.\n\n5. **No evidence of exclusive generator brand partnership.** No mention of Caterpillar, Cummins, FG Wilson, or any other genset brand on their profiles. This means they're brand-agnostic on gensets -- open to relationship.\n\n## Key People Found\n\n| Name | Title | Source | Notes |\n|------|-------|--------|-------|\n| **Tunde Adeoti** | CEO / MD | [TheOrg](https://theorg.com/org/megawatts-nigeria-limited/org-chart/tunde-adeoti), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tundeadeoti/) | B.Eng Mechanical, Uni of Ilorin.

COREN. 10+ years construction. **THIS IS THE ENTRY POINT** -- his role is literally to find new partnerships/suppliers. |\n| **Afam Anyika** | Executive Director, Business Development | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Afam-Anyika/2088404572) | BSc, University of Nigeria Enugu. Previously: Head of Marketing & Communications at Helium Health, then Max (ride-hailing). Founded Elan Africa (marketing/BD). Accepted the 2023 award on behalf of the company. Newer to MEP industry -- came from tech/startup BD. |\n| **Olubukola Ojo** | Senior Business Development Officer | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Olubukola-Ojo/7753328361) | Mid-level BD. Could be initial warm-up contact before escalating to Olatunji or Afam. |\n| **Okotie Dukuye** | Manager, Commercial & Senior Quantity Surveyor | [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Okotie-Dukuye/12623961033) | Handles commercial/cost side. Would be involved in procurement decisions. |\n| **Samuel Adewale** | Project Engineer | [TheOrg](https://theorg.com/org/megawatts-nigeria-limited/org-chart/samuel-adewale) | Execution-level. Not a first contact. |\n\n**Recommended entry sequence:**\n1. **Olatunji Olawale James** (Head of Growth) -- his literal job is engineering market development. He evaluates supplier/partner relationships. LinkedIn connected, PMP, same university as CEO (Uni of Ilorin network).\n2. **Afam Anyika** (ED, Business Development) -- broader BD mandate, came from tech sector so may be receptive to modern sales approaches. But less technical than Olatunji.\n3. **Olubukola Ojo** (Senior BD Officer) -- softer entry if Olatunji/Afam feel too senior for cold approach.\n\n## Website Intel\n\n**Website:** megawattsng.com (could not fetch directly due to WebFetch restriction)\n**Secondary site:** megawatts.quanesisng.com (appears to be an older/alternate domain, possibly Quanesis platform)\n\n**From search snippets of the website:**\n- Services page confirms HVAC, electrical, piping engineering\n- About page has CEO bio and company history\n- ISO 9001 certification prominently featured\n- Describes themselves as \"infrastructure solutions provider\"\n- Emphasis on \"cost saving and safe MEP building services\"\n\n## Award Context\n\n**Award:** \"Best Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Company of the Year 2023\"\n**Awarded by:** World Quality Alliance at the International Standards Excellence Awards\n**Event:** World Standards Day Celebration, Nicon Luxury Hotels, Abuja\n**Date:** October 2023\n**Accepted by:** Afam Anyika (ED, Business Development)\n\n**Why this matters as a trigger:**\n- Award validates quality standards -- important for Mikano positioning (ISO-certified supplier to ISO-certified contractor)\n- Award was 2023 -- company has had time to leverage the recognition for winning new contracts in 2024-2025\n- Winning \"best M&E\" = they are considered top-tier in the exact category that specifies generators\n- Can be used as an opener: \"Congratulations on the World Standards Day award -- saw you were recognized as best M&E company...\"\n\n## Trigger Hypothesis\n\n**Primary hypothesis:** Megawatts Nigeria is the highest-value NODE prospect identified to date. They are an MEP contractor who writes generator specifications into building tender documents across multiple sectors. Each active project potentially requires backup power specification. With 2 ongoing projects, active hiring, and a 3-deep business development team actively seeking new partnerships, the timing is strong.\n\n**Specific triggers:**\n1. **14-floor Ikoyi residential tower** -- a project of this scale requires 500kVA-1000kVA+ diesel backup power. Someone is specifying that genset RIGHT NOW.\n2. **Active hiring (Nov 2025)** -- hiring mechanical project engineers signals growing project pipeline.\n3. **Head of Growth role exists** -- Olatunji's job is literally to develop engineering market partnerships. Mikano genset partnership fits his mandate perfectly.\n4. **No visible genset brand loyalty** -- no mention of Caterpillar, Cummins, FG Wilson anywhere. They're not locked into a competitor.\n5. **ISO 9001 match** -- both Mikano and Megawatts are ISO certified. Quality-standards alignment is a real talking point.\n6. **Award momentum** -- post-award period (2024-2026) likely means increased project volume and visibility.\n\n**Messaging angle for Olatunji:**\n- \"Saw Megawatts won Best M&E at the International Standards Excellence Awards -- impressive. We supply Mikano gensets across Lagos/Abuja and I noticed MEP firms like yours are the ones who actually shape what goes into the spec. Would love to understand how you currently approach backup power specification on your projects.\"\n- This positions as peer-to-peer (engineering market development), not vendor pitch.\n\n**NODE multiplier logic:**\n- Megawatts touches multiple external clients per year (developers, corporates, government)\n- Each client project = separate genset procurement\n- If Megawatts standardizes on Mikano in their specs, that's potentially 5-10+ genset sales per year from ONE relationship\n- This is the definition of a 5-10x pipeline multiplier\n\n## Score\n\n- **Company relevance: 9/10** -- MEP contractor is the exact profile that specifies generators. They work across construction, real estate, oil & gas, healthcare -- all high genset-demand sectors. Only reason not 10/10 is we don't have confirmed genset procurement history.\n\n- **Trigger strength: 7/10** -- Active projects (14-floor tower), active hiring, 3-deep BD team hunting partnerships. No single \"buying now\" signal, but multiple indicators of growth and active project pipeline. The award is a warm conversation opener.\n\n- **Node value: 10/10** -- This is the #1 node gap in the pipeline filled. MEP contractors write genset specs into tender documents. Zero MEP firms currently in pipeline. Megawatts has 9+ projects, serves multiple sectors, and has a dedicated growth role. The pipeline multiplier here is real and proven by the business model (one MEP firm = many client projects = many genset specs).\n\n**Overall: HIGH PRIORITY. Recommend immediate addition to pipeline as NODE class, Tier A candidate.**\n\n**Classification:** NODE (MEP contractor, touches multiple external projects/year)\n**Product fit:** DIESEL (primary) / BOTH (some industrial clients may need gas)\n**Recommended stage:** R1 (Research complete, ready for first outreach)\n**Recommended target:** Olatunji Olawale James (Head of Growth & Engineering Market Development)\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Megawatts Nigeria Limited -- TheOrg](https://theorg.com/org/megawatts-nigeria-limited)\n- [Megawatts Nigeria Limited -- LinkedIn](https://ng.linkedin.com/company/megawatts-nigeria-limited)\n- [Megawatts Wins Best M&E Award -- THISDAY](https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2023/10/26/megawatts-wins-best-electrical-mechanical-company-award-at-world-standards-day-celebration)\n- [Tunde Adeoti CEO -- TheOrg](https://theorg.com/org/megawatts-nigeria-limited/org-chart/tunde-adeoti)\n- [Tunde Adeoti -- LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tundeadeoti/)\n- [Olatunji Olawale James -- LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oolatunji/)\n- [Afam Anyika -- ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Afam-Anyika/2088404572)\n- [Megawatts Nigeria -- ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/c/megawatts-nigeria-ltd/346218839)\n- [Megawatts -- Knewrow Case Study](https://knewrow.com/cases/megawatts-nigeria-limited/)\n- [Megawatts -- Estate Intel](https://estateintel.com/app/directory/megawatts-nigeria-limited)\n- [Megawatts Nigeria -- About Page](https://megawatts.quanesisng.com/about/)\n- [Megawatts Services](https://megawattsng.com/services/)\n- [Megawatts Hiring -- MyJobMag](https://www.myjobmag.com/job/mechanical-project-engineer-megawatts-nigeria-limited)\n\n---\nSources (80/20):\n- 40% -- ZoomInfo employee directory + TheOrg org chart (people, titles, structure)\n- 30% -- THISDAY award article + LinkedIn company page (credibility, award context)\n- 20% -- Estate Intel project data + MyJobMag hiring (triggers)\n- 10% -- Internal pipeline.md + contact-cache.json (scoring context, gap validation)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3352,"cache_read_input_tokens":35073,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3352},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY4Q4xxMN2Y8TqLoZpanr","type":"assistant","uuid":"9503c796-b3ab-407c-9c94-80fc5bdade93","timestamp":"2026-02-12T15:19:55.744Z"}
