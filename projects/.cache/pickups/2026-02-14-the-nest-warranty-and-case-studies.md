## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Friday session focused on The Nest deal — a 250kVA Perkins generator sale for a 5-family apartment block in Ikoyi. The customer's analysis PDF (built with AI) claimed Mikano Perkins has a 4-year warranty. WRONG: actual warranty is 1 year. This flips the deal — JMG FG Wilson (18-month warranty, N62.0M) is now objectively better value than Mikano Perkins (12-month warranty, N64.3M at standard 29% discount). Ran discount math: 32% = price match, 33% = clear win (N1.3M cheaper, customer can self-insure the warranty gap). At 33%, margin is still N3M (5.3%) — thin but positive. Need manager approval for 4 extra points. Also realized The Nest journey (8 phases from "simple sell" to complex analysis) IS an internal case study — tools used, friction points, formats that worked. Internal case studies accumulate into external ones. Want GitHub Issues for persistent deal state so Monday doesn't start from scratch.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#13 [SELL, due-friday] Mikano Decision Day prep — The Nest deal is THE decision
#22 [OPS] Build /pickup skill — DONE (this file proves it)
#19 [BUILD] Video pipeline — parked
#17 [OPS] Auto-refresh OAuth on VPS — parked
#10 [OPS] Sync skills to VPS — parked

## Streams
- The Nest Deal [ACTIVE] — warranty flaw found, 33% discount = win, needs manager approval Monday
- Internal Case Studies [NOT STARTED] — The Nest = first candidate, framework identified not yet written
- Puma Trial Prep [PARKED] — compressed lessons ready for review, trial starts Tue
- FGCH Landing [PARKED] — hero video loop remaining, page otherwise complete
- Clodura TAM [PARKED] — 5 more firms to search, 76+ contacts so far

## Next
1. Check `gh issue list` for The Nest deal issue (create if not done in session)
2. Get Monday intel: has customer seen the PDF? Can manager approve 33%? Warranty terms in writing?
3. Update The Nest analysis if discount approved (regenerate comparison with correct warranty + new price)
4. Start internal case study doc at /projects/mikano/case-studies/ — The Nest as first entry
5. Review compressed Puma lessons before Tuesday trial

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Mikano Perkins warranty = 1 YEAR (not 4). The customer PDF is wrong on this.
- 33% discount is the target number (N1.3M cheaper than JMG at that point)
- Floor = basic price at 21% off open type = N53.46M (absolute minimum)
- Internal case studies come FIRST, external case studies are derived from them
- GitHub Issues = persistent deal state tracker (don't start from scratch each session)

## Open (needs human input)
- Has The Nest PDF been shared with the families already? (if yes, warranty error is live)
- Can manager approve 33% discount? (4 points beyond standard 29%)
- What are the actual warranty terms in writing? (get the document)
- Are existing generators on-site Mikano-sourced? (brand loyalty angle for the close)
- Create GitHub issue for The Nest deal state? (intended this session, may not have been done)
