## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Massive overnight session spanning Feb 14 midnight → Feb 15 4am. Started with PUMA quick fixes + deep self-reflection (12 Traits 47/60, governor 2/5). Then cascaded: FGCH landing V1 (10 upgrades), PUMA expansion (Games, Profile, manager view), processed PUMA staff feedback (Peter's "too long" + team video transcripts), ran /design-round with Variant (5 prompts → 10 exports → 9 scored designs), scaffolded /design-round + /mine + /shape skills, created world-building content sprint plan, ran FGCH specialist review, ran Day 45 reflection with corrections, researched voice-to-correction tools. Most recent: created #27 Governor Training System on GitHub (Option C — dedicated track + embedded in work). 531 lines uncommitted PUMA changes + ~30 untracked files (agent outputs, pickups, transcripts, knowledge-graph, Variant exports).

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#27 [SELF] Governor Training System ← JUST CREATED
#7  [SELL/this-week] GRM follow-up
#6  [PROOF/this-week] HBS case study
#23 [OPS] Weekly 12 Traits review — Sunday (tomorrow)

## Streams
- Governor System [DONE] — #27 created, Option C, linked #23
- PUMA Design Round [ACTIVE] — 9 variants scored, waiting user "complex resolve" pick
- PUMA Code [UNCOMMITTED] — 531 lines changed across 8 files
- FGCH Landing [DONE] — V1 showable, specialist review done
- Skills Scaffolded [DONE] — /design-round, /mine, /shape, /bug-found
- Content Sprint [PLANNED] — world-building tweets, case studies, VV

## Next
1. COMMIT the 531 uncommitted PUMA lines + ~30 untracked files
2. SLEEP — it's 4am, governor score is 2/5, this is the pattern
3. Sunday: 12 Traits weekly review (#23), plan Monday, NO BUILDING
4. Lock PUMA final design picks after "complex resolve"

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Governor = Option C (dedicated track #27 + embedded in work)
- PUMA nav: 4 tabs, #080808 black, #D4FF00 lime, glass morphism
- Sunday = build-free governor training day
- Tuesday 6pm = show PUMA to staff (not trial day 1)

## Open (needs human input)
- "Complex resolve" from Variant — user hasn't shown it yet
- Daily pulse journal format — voice note? .md file? Which tool?
- Grid texture on Practice page — keep or drop?
