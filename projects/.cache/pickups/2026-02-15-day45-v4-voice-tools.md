## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Day 45 session continued. Three things shipped: (1) Day 45 HTML artifact now at v4 — vertical timeline, RAISED seeds table with rubric columns, decision pairs with WHY reasoning, change tags, dark mode toggle, Puma onboarding changed to Tuesday Feb 25. (2) Voice review tools research complete — lightning-whisper-mlx installed (pip, --no-deps). 20 tools evaluated, whisper-writer with Claude integration = best next step. (3) Puma demo debrief saved at retail/puma/debrief/. LAST FEEDBACK (v4 review): WHY reasoning on decision pairs is too small — needs bigger text, separate row, white/faded background so it reads clearly. POST bottleneck needs more prominence in flywheel section. Cap = auto-transcription on recordings, understood.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#23 [OPS] Weekly 12 Traits review — Sunday Feb 16
#26 [BUILD] Improve capture: screenshot → context → library pipeline
#24 [OPS] Guided Agent Architecture
#25 [OPS] Improve capture: visual references
#21 [BUILD] Cartoon avatar world-building

## Streams
- Day45-HTML [v4 DONE, feedback pending] — WHY row needs bigger/separate/faded-bg styling
- Voice-tools [DONE] — lightning-whisper-mlx installed, research saved
- Puma-debrief [DONE] — transcript + debrief written, onboarding Tue Feb 25
- Mine-skill [NOT STARTED] — first /mine run on today's dumps, DROP group

## Next
1. Fix WHY reasoning row on decision pairs (bigger, separate, faded white background)
2. First /mine run — test on today's dumps, DROP group, JSON atoms
3. Sunday: 12 Traits weekly review (GH #23)
4. Message Timmy re: Puma onboarding Tuesday Feb 25
5. HBS case study (GH #6)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Timeline vertical (not horizontal) — this was the improvement
- RAISED seeds table with rubric columns (Best Now?/Evidence/Friction) — works
- Puma onboarding = TUESDAY Feb 25 (not Monday)
- Cap = auto-transcription on recordings (different from CleanShot X screenshots)
- Fractal = correct term (break into pieces, JSON each recursively)

## Open (needs human input)
- Which RAISED seed has highest pull right now? (proof of work confirmed highest)
- When to message Timmy about onboarding?
