## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Big Saturday session. Four things shipped: (1) Processed Olly Rosewell video — full 9-section analysis with personal takes, API-first build order confirmed. (2) Researched and enabled agent teams — tested by spawning a researcher teammate for skill gap analysis. (3) Built /pickup skill from scratch — 4 rounds ASCII-first design, replaces /checkpoint + /session-update. (4) Mapped all 16 GitHub issues against "agent teams worth the tokens?" — fan-out patterns (same task × different inputs) = best value. Clodura (#3) identified as first real agent team execution but needs system design + ASCII planning FIRST. Three issues need closing (#13 done, #20 done, #22 done). User wants token cost as % of subscription. PUMA remains top priority before new builds.

## Read First (for laptop/VPS — skip on mobile)
1. /Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/trellomcp/trello-mcp/projects/learn/video-kb/bookmarks/2026-02-14-api-profitable-software.md (17KB)
2. /Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/.claude/skills/pickup/SKILL.md (9KB)
3. /Users/nicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker/.claude/settings.json (383B)

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#3 [SELL] Clodura TAM search — needs system design + ASCII before fan-out ← NEXT AGENT TEAM TARGET
#6 [PROOF] HBS case study — build landing page/flow FIRST, case study comes from the build
#5 [BUILD] FGCH handoff — single file, no agent teams needed
#7 [SELL] GRM follow-up — waiting
#19 [BUILD] Video pipeline — needs more use before productizing

## Streams
- Video analysis [DONE] — Olly Rosewell 9-section analysis + 62 frames, pushed to GitHub
- Agent teams [DONE] — enabled, tested, value-mapped against all 16 issues
- /pickup skill [DONE] — v4 ASCII, built SKILL.md, first save test passed
- Agent teams value map [DONE] — fan-out patterns = best ROI, Clodura = first target
- Board cleanup [NOT STARTED] — close #13, #20, #22; check #14; add new issues

## Next
1. Close issues #13, #20, #22 on GitHub (already completed)
2. Check #14 status — user thinks 6-mission compression may already be done
3. System design + ASCII for Clodura (#3) fan-out — plan before execute
4. PUMA client work (confirmed top priority before new builds)

## Decided
- API-first build order (not UI-first)
- PUMA before any new builds
- /pickup replaces /checkpoint + /session-update
- Agent teams worth tokens for fan-out patterns (same task × N inputs)
- Clodura needs planning/ASCII before agent execution
- HBS = build product/landing page FIRST, case study follows from the build
- GitHub issues = source of truth

## Open
- Token cost of today's session as % of subscription
- Will #14 (compress 6 missions) already be done? Need to check
- Where exactly on the work map do agent teams add most value vs cost?
