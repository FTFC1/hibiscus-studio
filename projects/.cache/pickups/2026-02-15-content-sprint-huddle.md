## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Ran a full /huddle (5 personas: OPS, PROOF, BRAND, VOICE, AUDIENCE) on the content sprint / world-building stream. All 5 reports completed and saved as agent outputs. Key findings: (1) OPS mapped a 6-step sequence — polish deploys → screenshot template → voice ref extraction → content calendar → tweet compression process → execute sprint. Steps 1+3 are ready now, steps 2/4/5 need building. (2) PROOF ranked top 3 proof items: velocity jump (2025→2026), PUMA trial story, 47-item sprint grid. Lead with velocity arc (viral tweet → 6 deploys), then proof grid. (3) BRAND found Sales CRM dark mode IS the brand aesthetic — HB Calculator glassmorphic is off-brand for lead content. Packaging template drafted (dark bg, centered crop, mono palette). (4) VOICE extracted compression patterns from 370 tweets — "Build → Screenshot → Minimal caption" formula. Anti-AI rules documented. (5) AUDIENCE: position as "designer who builds with AI" not "AI builder" — the Replit viral worked because of designer identity. First content = velocity arc thread.

## Next
1. Decide: sprint THIS WEEK or park until March? (OPS question)
2. If sprinting: deploy assessment (30 min) + voice ref extraction (45 min) tonight
3. Build screenshot packaging template (dark blue bg, mono, centered crop)
4. Draft content calendar (which deploys first, cadence)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Lead with Sales CRM dark mode aesthetic, NOT HB Calculator glassmorphic
- Position = "designer who builds with AI" (not pure AI builder)
- Velocity arc first (viral tweet → 6 deploys), proof grid second
- Voice formula: Build → Screenshot → Minimal caption → Let work speak
- No hype vocabulary, no LinkedIn opener voice, no guru posture

## Open (needs human input)
- Sprint THIS WEEK or park until March?
- Secondary brand color: lighter blue (#3366FF) or teal (#00A99D)?
