## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Continuation session. Applied all 8 missed P1 UI fixes to PUMA training app based on Nicholas's video feedback. Key changes: branded header (PUMA in lime), tighter mission card spacing, visual module header card, full-screen swipe (iOS conflict fix), better comparison slide hierarchy, down arrows on 3-step frameworks, 4-tab bottom nav (Home/Practice/Activity/Profile replacing Home/Games/Profile). Built, deployed to puma-training.vercel.app. Showed before/after for each fix. 17 P2/P3 items still remaining. Self-reflection voice note still unprocessed.

## Streams
- PUMA-app [ACTIVE] — All P1s fixed (11/11), deployed, 17 P2/P3 remaining
- Orchestrator [DONE] — /orchestrate skill scaffolded and live
- PRD-patterns [DONE] — Rosewell SlideForge analyzed, patterns extracted
- Self-reflection [PARKED] — Deep identity voice note captured but not processed

## Next
1. Get Nicholas's feedback on the 8 fixes (confirm or correct)
2. Apply P2 fixes if approved (bottom nav behavior, comparison acknowledgement, etc.)
3. Process Nicholas's self-reflection voice note into a proper capture
4. Prepare PUMA demo for Timmy

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- 4-tab nav: Home / Practice / Activity / Profile
- Branded header: PUMA (lime) + Training (white)
- Module header: visual card with icon + progress, not plain text
- Full-screen swipe: handlers on lesson-page, not just viewport
- Team agents > loose background tasks for parallel work

## Open (needs human input)
- Are the 8 P1 fixes correct? Review in browser.
- Self-reflection voice note: save as capture, session packet, or GitHub issue?
- PUMA demo timing: when is Timmy meeting?
