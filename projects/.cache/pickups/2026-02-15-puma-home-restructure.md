## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Continuation from Feb 14 PUMA session. Applied 8 P1 UI fixes, then Nicholas reviewed and said home page "looks the same." Did second pass — restructured My Training view: removed ProgressBanner (merged into module header), moved missions up as hero content, removed Team Activity from staff view (now in Activity tab), moved Quick Actions above Stats. Nicholas reviewed: module header = "really good", but below-fold still looks dated. Lesson pages still look ugly vs improved home. Manager dashboard needs rethink (should answer: what's wrong, what's good, what needs attention — not generic stats). Practice tab = good. Created GitHub issue #26 for capture improvement pipeline. Also captured meta-insight about business principles / periodic table / alchemy visualization for company building.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#7 [SELL/this-week] GRM follow-up after Thursday meeting
#26 [BUILD] Improve capture: screenshot → context → library pipeline
#24 [OPS] Guided Agent Architecture — company operating pattern
#19 [BUILD] Video Knowledge Pipeline — productize the process
#16 [] Ingest + apply 12 Traits of a Fountainhead

## Streams
- PUMA-app [ACTIVE] — Home restructured, module header approved, below-fold + lessons + manager still need work
- Capture-pipeline [RAISED] — GH #26 created, meta-insight about artifact agents captured
- Business-principles [RAISED] — Periodic table / alchemy viz for company building, mentioned but not shaped

## Next
1. Redesign below-fold content (mission cards, quick actions, stats — make them match module header quality)
2. Improve lesson page visual design (currently ugly vs improved home)
3. Rethink manager dashboard: what's wrong / what's good / what needs attention
4. Address "3/6 missions" redundancy (visible from checkmarks already)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Module header = approved design (icon + label + title + progress + streak in one card)
- ProgressBanner removed from staff view (merged into module header)
- Team Activity removed from staff view (now in Activity tab)
- 4-tab nav: Home / Practice / Activity / Profile
- Practice tab = good concept, keep it
- Manager dashboard needs: "What's wrong? What's good? What needs my attention?"

## Open (needs human input)
- Below-fold mission card redesign: darker cards? Different layout? Reference skill.adapt?
- Lesson page: how much visual overhaul? Match home quality or separate design?
- Manager dashboard: what specific metrics matter? (Completion rate? Quiz scores? Engagement frequency?)
- Business principles storage: where does the alchemy/periodic table pattern library live?
