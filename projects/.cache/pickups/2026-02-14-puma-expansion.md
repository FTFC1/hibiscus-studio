## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Continued Saturday mega-session. After the earlier 3-agent convergence (regulate/sell/build) and PUMA quick fixes (bar numbers, hint text, QR sheet — committed), pivoted to two things: (1) FGCH ganache landing page visual overhaul — 10 design upgrades, image container fixes, V1-showable to Rochelle. Issue #5 closed (Variant handoff). (2) PUMA app expansion — added new pages (Games, Profile, Home.css), expanded missions.js with 369+ new lines, refactored Home.jsx and lesson components. 552 insertions across 5 modified files + 4 new files, ALL UNCOMMITTED. Vite dev server was running background (b2e9a99). Context compacted twice tonight — this is post-second-compaction save.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)

## Streams
- PUMA Expansion [ACTIVE] — 552 insertions uncommitted. Games, Profile, Home pages added. missions.js expanded.
- FGCH Landing Page [DONE] — V1 showable. 10 upgrades applied. Show Rochelle next.
- 3-Agent Convergence [DONE] — regulate + sell + build. Outputs in .cache/agent-outputs/.
- PUMA Quick Fixes [DONE] — Bar numbers, hint text, QR sheet. Committed.

## Next
1. COMMIT the uncommitted PUMA work (552 insertions, 4 new files)
2. Sunday: 12 Traits weekly review (#23) — compare to baseline
3. Sunday: Plan Monday (research + sell targets). Build-free governor training day.
4. Show Rochelle FGCH landing page (she's available Feb, traveling Mar-Apr)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Sunday = build-free day. Governor training. Plan + review + movement + rest.
- Tuesday PUMA = showing to staff, NOT trial day 1.
- Identity: technical operator. Governor = THE bottleneck (2/5).
- Building sandwiches selling = daily rhythm.
- FGCH story-funnel = LATER, after Rochelle reviews V1.

## Open (needs human input)
- Spot the Difference visual pass — what specifically needs improving?
- Try This Today persistence — sticky footer vs separate screen vs Quick Ref integration?
- When to show Rochelle the FGCH page?
