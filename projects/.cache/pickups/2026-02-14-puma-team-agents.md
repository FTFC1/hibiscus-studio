## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Massive session. Wired all 6 PUMA training missions into React app, deployed to puma-training.vercel.app. Nicholas recorded 3 iPhone screen recordings (~17 min) reviewing the deployed app. Transcribed with Whisper, then ran a 3-agent team to process everything in parallel: (1) extracted 28 UI feedback items from videos, (2) processed Olly Rosewell's SlideForge PRD into video-kb + design patterns, (3) designed and scaffolded /orchestrate meta-skill (periodic table taxonomy + football formation + token routing). Applied 6 P1 fixes (clickable avatar, full-screen swipe, practice "Start My Day" button, outline Reference button, clearer Quick Actions). Redeployed. /orchestrate skill is now live globally. Still 17 P2/P3 items remaining. Nicholas also gave a deep self-reflection voice note about identity (coder learning business, not salesperson learning tech) that needs capturing separately.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#4 [SELL/due-friday] Draft BTL connection notes for top targets
#3 [SELL/due-friday] Resume Clodura TAM search (5 firms)
#7 [SELL/this-week] GRM follow-up after Thursday meeting
#6 [PROOF/this-week] Write HBS case study from bot building
#19 [BUILD] Video Knowledge Pipeline — productize the process

## Streams
- PUMA-app [ACTIVE] — 6 missions wired, deployed, 6/11 P1s fixed, 17 P2/P3 remaining
- Orchestrator [DONE] — /orchestrate skill scaffolded and live
- PRD-patterns [DONE] — Rosewell SlideForge analyzed, patterns extracted
- Self-reflection [PARKED] — Deep identity voice note captured but not processed

## Next
1. Apply remaining P2 PUMA fixes (bottom nav rethink, Module 1 visual, comparison slide hierarchy)
2. Process Nicholas's self-reflection voice note into a proper capture
3. Test /orchestrate skill on a real compound task
4. Prepare PUMA demo for Timmy (get manager approval)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Team agents > loose background tasks for parallel work
- Periodic table taxonomy = orchestrator command structure
- Token routing: Haiku for extraction, Sonnet for code, Opus for architecture
- Quick Actions renamed: Quick Quiz / Today's Tasks / View Progress

## Open (needs human input)
- Bottom nav structure: Home/Practice/Activity/Profile or keep current?
- Self-reflection voice note: save as capture, session packet, or GitHub issue?
- PUMA demo timing: when is Timmy meeting?
