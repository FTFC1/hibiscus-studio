## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Processed 3 new iPhone screen recordings (18 min total) of Nicholas reviewing the PUMA training app + browsing skill.adapt (Ryan Singer's site) as design reference. Extracted 39 items: 20 PUMA app feedback (8 P1), 4 tooling ideas, 7 architecture items (most already built in /orchestrate), 3 business insights. Also scaffolded /shape skill (product shaping: page tree → priority → design order → flows → slices) and saved SlideForge PRD to video-kb as reference. Key finding: lesson page has 4 P1 items and is the #1 design priority. Nicholas independently described the butler/formation/periodic-table concepts that /orchestrate already implements — validates the architecture.

## Streams
- PUMA-feedback-v2 [DONE] — 39 items extracted, mapped to page tree, saved
- PUMA-app [ACTIVE] — lesson page redesign = next slice (4 P1 items)
- Shape-skill [DONE] — /shape scaffolded at ~/.claude/skills/shape/SKILL.md
- PRD-reference [DONE] — SlideForge PRD saved to video-kb

## Next
1. Run /shape on PUMA app → produce ASCII lesson page flow → get corrections → implement
2. Fix 8 P1 items (4 lesson + 4 home) using /shape design order
3. Lesson page visual overhaul: typography hierarchy, card styling (skill.adapt reference), dynamic sticky bar
4. Home quick actions: fix labels (which game? submit review? view log?)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Design order: Lesson page → Home (staff) → Profile polish
- skill.adapt = design quality reference (spacing, text-to-visual ratio, dark cards, interactivity)
- /orchestrate architecture validated by Nicholas's independent description
- /shape skill scaffolded and ready for first use
- Manager view = "great" (no changes needed)
- 4-tab nav confirmed (Home/Practice/Activity/Profile)

## Open (needs human input)
- Lesson page: how visual should the treatment be? (Duolingo-style gamified vs skill.adapt-style editorial?)
- Quick action cards: what EXACTLY are Play Game, Daily Review, Practice Log supposed to do?
- Pattern library: where should design references live? (video-kb? separate directory?)
- Support ticket in Profile: scope for MVP vs future?
