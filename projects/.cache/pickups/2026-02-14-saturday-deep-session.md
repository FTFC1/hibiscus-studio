## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Massive Saturday session. Shipped: (1) Olly Rosewell API video — 9-section analysis, API-first build order. (2) Agent teams enabled + value-mapped. (3) /pickup skill built from scratch. (4) Two X articles ingested: OpenClaw (auto-learning pipeline = diamond, cold DM = fails) and 12 Traits (Metacognition 5/5, Cross-Domain 5/5, Emotional Regulation 2/5 — "engine with undertrained governor"). Deep self-reflection done — baseline assessment saved at reviews/2026-02-14-baseline-self-assessment.md. Identity: technical operator (not developer, not consultant, not PM). 18 months mapped. Compounding advantage confirmed. Closing builds + deals = the path, not more systems. Daily journaling on traits → Sunday review. #23 created for weekly review practice. 6 issues closed, #16 updated.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#3 [SELL] Clodura TAM search — needs ASCII system design before fan-out
#6 [PROOF] HBS case study — build product FIRST, case study follows
#7 [SELL] GRM follow-up — waiting
#9 [BUILD] Aloe Bot — V3 live, HBS helper in TG, next bot needs ASCII
#23 [OPS] Weekly 12 Traits review — first Sunday review Feb 16 ← NEW

## Streams
- Video Analysis [DONE] — Olly Rosewell 9-section + 62 frames
- Agent Teams [DONE] — enabled, tested, fan-out-and-converge confirmed
- /pickup skill [DONE] — built, saves + pushes working
- OpenClaw + 12 Traits [DONE] — analyzed, adapted, baseline saved
- Self-Reflection [DONE] — baseline assessment created, identity clarified

## Next
1. Sunday: First 12 Traits weekly review (compare to baseline)
2. Monday: The Nest — manager approval for 33% discount
3. Tuesday: PUMA trial prep (confirm it's launching)
4. Create remaining issues: auto-learning pipeline, /enrich skill
5. Update stale issues: #5, #9, #17, #19

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Identity: technical operator. Fractional CTO / AI ops / solo SaaS.
- Closing = builds AND deals (not just generator sales)
- North Star timeline: pushing, not a specific month
- Daily journaling on traits → Sunday 12 Traits recursive review
- Don't need to learn more. Need to close more.
- Baseline saved at reviews/ — future reviews compare against it

## Open (needs human input)
- PUMA trial approved + launching Tuesday?
- Daily journal format — what tool/file? (could be simple .md or voice note)
- Remaining new issues — create now or Monday?
