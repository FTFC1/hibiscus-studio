## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Day 45 of 2026. Three-phase session: (1) Two-round voice brain dump processed — central theme is permissionless flywheel (build→document→content→post→work→repeat). POST = missing piece. 9 threads extracted, 55+ items, 19 decisions. (2) Voice review of Day 45 HTML artifact — 12 corrections applied: easel board aesthetic (off-white receipt paper), Telegram and VPS SEPARATED into distinct threads, tensions now flickable carousel with suggested solutions, timeline annotated with milestones, flywheel text bigger with joined arrows, RAISED cap corrected to "cream rises" not hard 5, Jack Butcher "Sawdust" reference added to proof of work. (3) Puma demo transcript (Feb 12 meeting) fully processed — debrief written with participant analysis, strong moments, feedback by person, missed opportunities, and next steps. Trial approved at Palms/Lekki, 6-7 weeks, fee waived.

## Next
1. First real /mine run (test the skill on these dumps)
2. Voice review tools research — GitHub, better voice → correction workflow
3. Sunday: 12 Traits weekly review (#23)
4. Lock Puma onboarding date with Timmy
5. Shorten PUMA lessons (Peter feedback: 2-3 pages, 5 minutes)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Flywheel > business (permissionless, know margin, compound)
- Telegram and VPS = SEPARATE projects (don't group)
- RAISED cap = quality threshold ("cream rises"), not hard 5
- Proof of work connects to Jack Butcher "Sawdust" / VV
- Easel board aesthetic: off-white receipt paper, monospace, CSS-styled ASCII
- Tensions format: A vs B left/right, flickable carousel, with suggested solutions
- Fractal JSON extraction: break into pieces, JSON each piece (cost optimization)
- Puma trial: 6-7 weeks at Palms, fee waived, need upsell matrix from PRL
- Bedtime: 1:00-1:30am target

## Open (needs human input)
- Voice review tools: which GitHub projects to evaluate?
- Puma onboarding date: when to message Timmy?
- Which RAISED seed has highest pull right now? (7 seeds active)
