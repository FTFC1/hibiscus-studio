## Context (self-contained)
Designed a "Guided Agent Architecture" — rubric-driven specialists coordinated by a transparent guide (the rubric itself, not a persona). T-shirt sizing gate: S=just do it, M=1-2 specialists, L=full architecture. Created GitHub issue #24 for the pattern. Applied it to FGCH landing page at size M: spun up 2 background specialists (above-fold architect + micro-interaction designer). Both completed. Architect researched real workshop sites (Pump Street Chocolate, PL&C, Obby, ClassBento) and delivered 5 structural findings. Micro-interaction designer delivered 5 CSS/JS animation techniques. Combined into FGCH-SPECIALIST-REVIEW.html. User reviewed all 10 findings via ASCII before/after diagrams. Key feedback: trust bar should auto-scroll horizontally (not static), price reveal should be A/B testable, full-bleed hero needs Variant exploration before building (design layout isn't Claude's strength), gift vs self CTAs need A/B testing, 3 sensory copy options liked but not chosen yet. User wants agent review process — engineering person reviews agent output via screen records, updates system. Also created GitHub issue #25 (capture improvements) and #26 (screenshot pipeline).

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues)
#24 [OPS] Guided Agent Architecture — company operating pattern
#25 [OPS] Improve capture: visual references, pattern library, artifact agents
#6  [PROOF] Write HBS case study — this-week
#7  [SELL] GRM follow-up — this-week
#4  [SELL] Draft BTL connection notes — due-friday

## Streams
- FGCH Landing Page [ACTIVE] — 10 specialist findings reviewed. Ready to implement chosen techniques.
- Guided Agent Architecture [DONE] — v2 designed, issue #24 created, first use (size M) completed.
- Capture Improvements [PARKED] — Issues #25 + #26 created. Not started.
- Hero Upgrade Shaping [MERGED] — /recursive ideas merged into specialist findings.

## Next
1. Choose copy option (A invitation / B gift / C sensory) and implement
2. Use Variant to explore full-bleed hero layout before building (user request)
3. Implement top 5 techniques (hero entrance, trust bar, sticky CTA, scroll reveal, Ken Burns)
4. Show Rochelle the page (she's available Feb, traveling Mar-Apr)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Guided Agent Architecture = rubric is the guide, not a persona. Transparent, editable.
- ASCII-first for showing techniques — text descriptions of animations are useless
- Trust bar should auto-scroll horizontally (marquee-style), not static
- Full-bleed hero needs Variant layout exploration first, not direct build
- Agent time estimates need calibration against actual build times

## Open (needs human input)
- Copy option: A (invitation), B (gift buyer), or C (sensory)?
- Gift vs self CTA weighting — A/B test needed. Do more people buy as gifts or for themselves?
- Price in sticky CTA: show immediately or hold back for conversion measurement?
- Agent review process: how to structure engineering reviews of agent output?
