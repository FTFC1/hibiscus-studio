## Context (self-contained)
First real /mine run completed. Mined 4 sources into the knowledge graph: tweets-n-stuff-synthesis, day45-review-corrections, puma-debrief, build-backlog-audit. Graph now has 52 atoms. Mid-session, designed and built the "so what" layer — 4-bin arrangement (convictions/pulls/tensions/orphans) + type summaries that replace the dot graph. Updated SKILL.md with both features as automatic (no separate command). Weight leaders: faceless ASCII content (w=3) and butcher/sawdust/proof-from-work (w=3). Key discovery: atom-040 (close harder in selling) and atom-004 (POST gap in content) are the same valve pattern — building well but releasing cautiously.

## Read First
1. ~/.claude/skills/mine/SKILL.md (11K) — updated skill with 4 bins + type summaries
2. projects/.cache/knowledge-graph/atoms.json (24K) — all 52 atoms
3. projects/.cache/knowledge-graph/index.md (1K) — graph summary + clusters

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#7 [SELL][this-week] GRM follow-up after Thursday meeting
#6 [PROOF][this-week] Write HBS case study from bot building
#27 [OPS] Governor Training System
#26 [BUILD] Screenshot → context → library pipeline
#24 [OPS] Guided Agent Architecture

## Streams
- /mine testing [DONE] — 4 sources mined, skill updated, graph seeded
- FGCH ganache landing [PARKED] — specialist review done, /recursive shaping in progress
- PUMA design round [PARKED] — variant prompts generated, awaiting Variant.ai output

## Next
1. Mine remaining sources: neurodivergent-builder-regulation (32K), pipeline-audit (26K), puma-feedback-v2 (7K+11K), voice-to-correction-tools (17K)
2. Content/distribution cluster (7 atoms) has no stream — seed one?
3. Valve pattern (build-but-don't-release) — decide by Feb 22: habit to fix or style to accept?

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Dot graph visualization killed — type summaries are scannable, graphs are not
- 4 bins run automatically after every mine — no separate /mine surface command
- Atom corrections are data — add corrected field, don't delete atoms

## Open (needs human input)
- Content/distribution stream: seed from the 7-atom cluster?
- Valve pattern deadline: is Feb 22 the right forcing function?
