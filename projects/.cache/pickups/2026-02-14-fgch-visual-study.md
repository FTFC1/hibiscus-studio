## Context (self-contained)
Upgraded the Flour Girls Cakehouse ganache landing page from "functional" to "showable." Started by closing GitHub issue #5 (Variant handoff — Variant produced too-similar outputs, confirmed it can't change interaction models). Then ran /huddle on whether to rebuild as a story-funnel — BUILD pushed back: "polishing in a vacuum with 0 users." Pinterest food photography reference (timestamp journey, image-first) is banked as a future direction.

Main work: fixed all image containers (were landscape boxes cropping square 1024x1024 AI images), then applied 10 design upgrades — premium brand header, card-style included items, structured Rochelle bio, Google Maps link, clock icons, interactive "I want to learn" / "I'm buying a gift" tabs, dietary multi-select pills, tel keypad input. Page is now V1-showable to Rochelle.

Key insight from user: "Skills are atoms, workflows are molecules." The huddle skill composed 5 personas reading different domains — that's a workflow. And it caught excitement mid-flight with honest pushback.

Late session: invoked /recursive to shape three hero-upgrade ideas — (1) psychologically smarter hero (brand > founder, sell the EXPERIENCE not the person), (2) video→JSON image pipeline (extract frames from Rochelle's 121min Telegram media via extract-frames.sh → reusable visual asset library), (3) real camera + AI blending (seal cam + robonuggets for cinematic hero imagery before April photoshoot). Shaping was in-progress when context ran out — ideas captured but not yet evaluated/refined.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues)
#6  [PROOF] Write HBS case study from bot building — this-week

## Streams
- FGCH Landing Page [ACTIVE] — V1 showable. 10 design upgrades applied. Images fit. Next: show Rochelle.
- Story Funnel Spike [PARKED] — Pinterest-inspired concept. Huddle said: only after Rochelle reviews V1.
- Hero Upgrade Shaping [IN PROGRESS] — 3 ideas mid-shape via /recursive: smart hero copy, video frame pipeline, camera+AI blend. Not yet evaluated.
- HBS Case Study [NOT STARTED] — Document what was built (calc, booking, admin, page) as proof. Sunday.
- Flower Girl Bot [PARKED] — Spec complete (11 rounds). 0% built. Needs Rochelle dog-fooding.

## Next
1. Show Rochelle the landing page (she's available in Feb, traveling Mar-Apr)
2. USP cards visual upgrade (still basic — consider Variant or manual redesign)
3. Wire booking form to existing HBS backend (real availability, not date picker)
4. Document HBS as case study #1 (Sunday)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Issue #5 closed — Variant can't change interaction model, only rearrange sections
- Story-funnel spike = LATER, after Rochelle reviews V1
- Bot gives 3-month plan (paid, not free). Calculator → Bot → Retainer.
- Page is a prep asset. Polish enough to show, don't over-engineer with 0 traffic.
- "Skills = atoms, workflows = molecules" — confirmed architecture insight

## Open (needs human input)
- When to show Rochelle? (she's available now, burnt out, trusts Nicholas)
- USP cards: Variant designs or manual CSS upgrade?
- Booking backend integration scope — full real-time availability or simpler?
