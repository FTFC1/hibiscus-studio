## Context (self-contained — works on any device)
Massive Saturday session. Two phases: (1) Earlier — Olly Rosewell API video, agent teams enabled, /pickup skill built, OpenClaw + 12 Traits articles ingested, 6 issues closed. (2) Later — Deep self-reflection (12 Traits baseline 47/60, governor 2/5, identity = technical operator), 3-agent convergence: regulate (neurodivergent builder curriculum + INCUP framework), sell (pipeline CRITICALLY THIN, 5 BTL profiles, 4 outreach templates, case study roadmaps), build (31 items across 4 tiers). PUMA 3 quick fixes applied + committed (bar numbers, hint text, QR sheet sizing). Governor training starts NOW. Building sandwiches selling = the daily rhythm.

## Board (top 5 GitHub issues by urgency)
#3 [SELL] Clodura TAM search — 5/10 firms done, needs remaining 5
#4 [SELL] BTL connection notes — due-friday (overdue), templates ready in pipeline audit
#7 [SELL] GRM follow-up — waiting on interview scheduling
#6 [PROOF] HBS case study — build product FIRST, case study follows
#23 [OPS] Weekly 12 Traits review — FIRST review Sunday Feb 16

## Streams
- Deep Self-Reflection [DONE] — 12 Traits baseline, 18-month arc, curriculum set
- 3-Agent Convergence [DONE] — regulate + sell + build, outputs saved
- PUMA Quick Fixes [DONE] — 3/6 fixes applied + committed (bar numbers, hint text, QR sheet)
- Video Analysis [DONE] — Olly Rosewell 9-section + 62 frames
- /pickup Skill [DONE] — built, saves + pushes working

## Next
1. Sunday: First 12 Traits weekly review (#23) — compare to baseline
2. Sunday: Plan Monday (research + sell targets). Build-free day = review + plan + rest.
3. Monday: Movement → /briefing → DSG sell prep → The Nest 33% approval → BTL outreach → PUMA finishing touches → shutdown ritual
4. Tuesday: Movement → outreach messages → 9-5 Mikano → 6pm show PUMA to staff (not trial day 1 yet)
5. Remaining PUMA fixes: Spot the Difference visual pass, Try This Today persistence (needs UX decision)

## Decided (don't re-litigate)
- Identity: technical operator. Not developer, not consultant, not PM.
- Governor = THE bottleneck (2/5). Training starts now, not after more building.
- Building sandwiches selling (high dopamine before AND after outreach).
- PUMA Tuesday = showing to staff, not trial day 1. Trial prep continues.
- Testimonial request = from Rochelle for HBS work (calculator, booking). Ask her directly.
- Pipeline is CRITICALLY THIN. 0 outreach sent. 0 case studies packaged.
- Sunday = build-free governor training day. Plan + review + movement + rest.

## Open (needs human input)
- Spot the Difference "could improve again" — what specifically?
- Try This Today persistence — sticky footer vs separate screen vs Quick Ref integration?
- Daily journal format for 12 Traits — voice notes? .md file? Which tool?
