## RAISED

- `seed` **Stream maintenance check** — after 1 week of using /stream, check: am I constantly correcting names/tags? If yes, system is overhead not leverage. Simplify or kill.
- `shaped` **Content visualization pipeline** — every system we build (/stream, /recursive, /capture, two-terminal, HUD, session map) becomes an explainer image → content piece. Consistent visual style. AI image gen. Formats: image alone, image+quote, image+bullets, image+blog. Benefits: (1) I internalize the system by distilling it, (2) content library builds itself from work already done. Sources to read: learn/video-kb JB outputs (Visualize Value), EP Module 6 (distribution/content ecosystems). Needs: define visual style, pick first system to visualize, test one end-to-end.
- `seed` **/capture vs /process-convo clarity** — these overlap in user's mind. Needs a clear one-line distinction. Capture = fast dump + 3 bullets + Notion seed. Process-convo = multi-speaker conversation → 5-pass extraction → thread map. Different triggers, different outputs.
