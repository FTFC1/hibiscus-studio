# Gmail Management Instructions - Hibiscus Studio

## 🔍 **Email Search Strategy**

### Primary Search Queries for Daily Email Checks:

1. **Today's Emails:**
   ```
   after:2025/06/20
   ```

2. **All Unread Emails (Most Important):**
   ```
   is:unread
   ```

3. **Business Enquiries (Custom Label):**
   ```
   label:enquiries
   ```

4. **Unread Enquiries Outside Inbox:**
   ```
   is:unread -in:inbox
   ```

5. **Recent Unread (Last 3 Days):**
   ```
   is:unread after:2025/06/17
   ```

## 🏷️ **Gmail Label System**

- **INBOX**: New emails, may get moved to custom labels
- **Label_7002953129239386366**: Custom "enquiries" label
- **IMPORTANT**: Gmail's auto-importance marking
- **CATEGORY_PERSONAL**: Gmail's category system
- **CATEGORY_UPDATES**: Automated notifications
- **SENT**: Outgoing emails
- **UNREAD**: Critical status - emails needing attention

## ⚠️ **Key Insight**
When emails are moved from INBOX to custom labels (like "enquiries"), they:
- ✅ Keep UNREAD status
- ❌ Lose INBOX label
- 🎯 **Result**: Standard inbox searches miss them!

## 📧 **Email Formatting Rules**

### ❌ DON'T USE:
- **Bold markdown** (asterisks) - doesn't work when pasted into Gmail
- Bullet points with asterisks or dashes
- Complex formatting that requires manual cleanup

### ✅ DO USE:
- Plain text with clear line breaks
- Simple numbered lists
- Clear paragraph separation
- Short, digestible sentences
- Assume recipients need simple, clear information
