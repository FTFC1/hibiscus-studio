Okay, so you know what? How about we do it like this instead? Club sheet today is Thursday, the 19th, so that admin follow-up 1 is not needed anymore. I basically want a WhatsApp-friendly message that I can just send to the founder. Be like, "By the way, this is what you have.

**Clarification Needed:**

1. **Who is "the founder"** you're messaging? (Which company/project?)

2. **What is the "club sheet"** you're referring to?

3. **What specifically does "this is what you have" refer to?** What information/updates do you want to share with them?

4. **What was "admin follow-up 1"** about that's no longer needed?

5. **What's the context/relationship** - is this a business update, project status, or something else?

6. **What tone** do you want - casual, professional, or somewhere in between?

(Wait for your response before I craft the WhatsApp message.)

Who is the founder of Messaging? The founder of Hibiscus Studio, i.e. my cousin. What is a club sheet? No, I think you misheard me. I meant to say that today is Thursday the 19th because you were talking about something on Tuesday but that's already been and gone. What specifically does this refer to? This is what's in your inbox, this is what is outstanding, this is what needs to be done. What was admin follow-up one? But why is it no longer needed? I mean that the thing that was on Tuesday was the context relationship. Is it a business update project update? It's just as if I'm managing her email for her. The tone is casual professional and yeah cool.

Create a casual-professional WhatsApp message for my cousin (founder of Hibiscus Studio) summarizing her outstanding Gmail inbox items that need her attention, filtering out the Tuesday item since it's now Thursday the 19th and that's passed.

**Answer:**

Hey! Just checked your emails - here's what's actually outstanding and needs your attention:

🔥 **URGENT - Peerspace Booking Inquiry**
Jasminka C. sent 5 messages about her creative event studio inquiry. She's asking about:
• Virtual tours 
• Availability beyond Tuesdays
• Early decorator access
• Working around Watford transport issues
This looks like a proper booking - needs quick response!

📧 **Private Hire Follow-up**

💼 **Business Inquiries** 
• Event space inquiry from someone interested in your studio

The Tuesday thing is sorted since it's already passed. These are the ones that actually need you to respond - rest is just promotional noise I filtered out.

Want me to draft any replies?

Yeah, I think we should still draught messages if needed so that I can basically do the whole summary for the day, and then I can reply to my own message with the different drafts because you have everything you need or do you have outstanding questions still?
