[Crafting Effective Deep Research Prompts for LLMs (Google Gemini and Others)

Introduction

Deep research tasks require well-structured prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) like Google Gemini or GPT-4. By crafting prompts deliberately, you can get skimmable, information-rich outputs that cater to both quick scanning and deep reading. The key is to use progressive disclosure – have the model present a compact summary upfront, a detailed analysis in the middle with clear structure, and a concise recap at the end. This guide provides a reusable prompt template, domain-specific examples, and practical tips to ensure your prompts yield structured, high-impact answers ready for immediate use.

Reusable Prompt Template (Progressive Disclosure Format)

Below is a general prompt template that works across domains. It ensures the model provides an executive summary, an organized detailed section, and a final summary of takeaways. You can fill in the {...} placeholders for your specific domain and topic:

You are an expert in **{Domain}**. 

**Task:** Research and analyze **{Topic/Question}** in depth.

**Format Instructions:** 
1. **Begin with a 3-5 sentence executive summary** highlighting the most important findings or answers (high-level overview).
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Break down the topic into clear sections with **markdown headings** for each sub-topic or key aspect. Under each heading, provide concise, information-rich content. Use **bullet points** for lists of facts, steps, or factors to keep it skimmable. If comparing options or categories, include a **table** to summarize differences or pros/cons side by side.
3. **Conclusion:** End with a **brief summary or a list of 2-3 key takeaways** that recap the most critical insights or recommendations from the analysis.

**Additional Guidelines:** 
- Focus on **insights and actionable information**. Explain *why* the facts matter or how they compare. 
- Keep the writing **concise but comprehensive** – information-dense with minimal fluff. 
- Use a **direct and professional tone** appropriate for a {Domain} expert. Avoid overly verbose explanations; be clear and to the point. 
- If needed, cite notable examples or evidence to support claims (no need to actually provide citations unless asked).

How it works: This template first sets a role/context (“You are an expert in X”) to anchor the model in the domain. It then clearly states the task or question. Next, it outlines the desired output structure in numbered steps: a short summary, detailed sections with specific formatting (headings, bullets, tables), and a concluding summary. Such explicit formatting instructions guide the model to produce a structured, easy-to-navigate answer ￼ ￼. The prompt also emphasizes insight and conciseness, helping the model focus on high-value content and avoid unnecessary filler ￼.

Examples of Prompt Template in Different Domains

To illustrate, here are example prompts using the above template across various domains. Each prompt is tailored to the subject matter but follows the same progressive disclosure format and structure instructions:

Technology (Example)

Prompt:

You are an expert in **cloud computing and IT architecture**. 

**Task:** Research and analyze **the impact of adopting edge computing versus cloud computing for IoT networks**.

**Format Instructions:**  
1. **Begin with a 3-5 sentence executive summary** of how edge computing and cloud computing differ for IoT, and the key implications of adopting each.  
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Use **headings** to break down important factors (e.g., “Latency and Performance”, “Security Implications”, “Cost and Infrastructure”). Under each heading, provide an in-depth comparison with **bullet points** (e.g., advantages of edge vs cloud for that factor). Include a **table** comparing **Edge vs. Cloud** on key metrics (response time, bandwidth usage, data privacy).  
3. **Conclusion:** End with a **brief summary** highlighting which approach is better suited for certain scenarios and list **3 key takeaways** for decision-makers.

**Additional Guidelines:** Focus on **insights** (e.g., where each approach excels or falters). Keep explanations technical but **concise and factual**, without fluff.

In this tech prompt, we set the context (“expert in cloud computing”), ask a specific comparison question, and explicitly request structured output: the model will summarize the edge vs. cloud trade-offs, then detail sections on latency, security, etc., and even produce a comparison table as instructed. The result will be a highly structured report – ideal for quickly scanning differences and deep-diving into each aspect as needed.

Business (Example)

Prompt:

You are a **business strategy analyst**. 

**Task:** Analyze **the market entry strategies for a new e-commerce startup** and how it can compete with established players.

**Format Instructions:**  
1. **Executive Summary (3-4 sentences):** Summarize the most viable market entry approach and key competitive advantages for the startup.  
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Organize the answer into sections with **headings**: e.g., “Target Market & Positioning”, “Marketing and Sales Strategy”, “Operational Challenges”. Under each, give specifics and **bullet-point lists** of tactics or considerations. Include a **comparison table** of at least **two entry strategies** (for instance, *niche differentiation vs. cost leadership*), listing **pros, cons, and risks** of each side by side.  
3. **Conclusion:** Provide a **short conclusion** with **2-3 bullet-point takeaways** (e.g., “Key success factors” or recommendations for the startup).

**Additional Guidelines:** Use a **professional tone**. Highlight any **insightful comparisons** (what incumbents do vs. what the startup can do differently). Keep content **concise yet insightful**, avoiding generic business jargon.

This business prompt ensures the model gives a structured analysis useful for a quick briefing. The executive summary delivers the punchline (recommended strategy) immediately. The body sections and the comparison table encourage the model to surface insights like comparative advantages and risks. Such an output would let a reader quickly grasp strategy options and key points of differentiation.

Psychology (Example)

Prompt:

You are a **psychology researcher**. 

**Task:** Conduct a deep-dive on **the effects of social media on adolescent mental health**, including key psychological theories and findings.

**Format Instructions:**  
1. **Executive Summary:** In 3-5 sentences, state the **overall impact of social media on teens’ mental health** (both positive and negative) and mention the most critical findings.  
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Use **headings** to structure the discussion, e.g., “Positive Effects (Support & Learning)”, “Negative Effects (Anxiety & Depression)”, “Moderating Factors (Usage Patterns, Self-Esteem)”. Under each, explain major findings or theories with concise paragraphs or **bullet points** for lists of effects. If appropriate, include a **table** summarizing **key studies or statistics** (e.g., study, sample size, notable result) to give a quick comparative overview of research evidence.  
3. **Conclusion:** End with a **brief summary or 3 key takeaways** (for example, how certain uses of social media can be beneficial, while unsupervised overuse is harmful, etc.).

**Additional Guidelines:** Write in an **academic yet accessible tone**. Emphasize **insights** (e.g., why certain effects happen, or which factors worsen/improve outcomes). Keep explanations **succinct**, focusing on study results and their implications rather than lengthy theoretical discourse.

In this psychology prompt, the model is guided to organize information by themes (positive vs negative effects), making the output easy to navigate. The use of bullet points and possibly a small data table of studies helps highlight evidence at a glance. A reader can quickly skim the headings and bullets to get the gist, or read the detailed paragraphs for deeper understanding. The final takeaways reinforce the most important conclusions.

Logistics (Example)

Prompt:

You are a **logistics and supply chain expert**. 

**Task:** Explain **how to optimize last-mile delivery in urban areas** and compare different approaches (e.g., local micro-warehouses vs. direct shipping, human couriers vs. drones).

**Format Instructions:**  
1. **Executive Summary:** Provide 2-3 sentences summarizing the **biggest challenges in last-mile delivery** and the **most effective optimization strategy** identified.  
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Use **headings** for each aspect: e.g., “Challenges in Urban Last-Mile Delivery”, “Approach 1: Local Micro-Warehouses”, “Approach 2: Drone Delivery”, “Approach 3: Crowdsourced Couriers”. Under each, use **bullet points** or short paragraphs to explain how that approach works and its pros/cons in cities. Include a **comparison table** that contrasts these approaches on metrics like **speed, cost, scalability, and regulatory hurdles**.  
3. **Conclusion:** Finish with **a brief recap** and **3 key recommendations** for a company looking to improve urban delivery (bulleted).

**Additional Guidelines:** Be **practical and solution-focused**. Highlight any **innovative insights** (e.g., use of technology, real-world examples). Ensure the answer is **to-the-point** and avoids unnecessary technical jargon.

This logistics prompt explicitly asks for comparisons between multiple approaches. The structured layout (challenges first, then each solution approach in turn) helps the model produce a comprehensive yet organized analysis. The requested comparison table forces a side-by-side evaluation of each method’s performance on key criteria, making it easy for a decision-maker to scan. Again, an initial summary and final recommendations ensure that even a quick read yields useful information.

Content Planning (Example)

Prompt:

You are an **expert content strategist**. 

**Task:** Develop a **content plan for a tech blog launching a new series on artificial intelligence**, ensuring a balance of technical depth and accessibility.

**Format Instructions:**  
1. **Executive Summary:** In a few sentences, outline the **overall content strategy** (e.g., target audience, tone, and primary goal of the AI series).  
2. **Detailed Plan:** Use **headings** to structure the plan: for example, “Audience and Tone Definition”, “Content Themes and Topics”, “Publishing Schedule”, “Promotion Strategy”. Under each heading, use **bullet points** or sub-items to list specifics (e.g., key topics within AI to cover, frequency of posts, channels for promotion). If helpful, include a **table or timeline** – for instance, a table listing **Week, Topic Title, Format, and Target Audience Level** – to visually layout the publishing schedule.  
3. **Conclusion:** End with **a short summary** of the plan’s expected outcomes and **2-3 key success factors** (bulleted).

**Additional Guidelines:** Keep the tone **practical and optimistic**. Ensure the output is **skimmable** – someone should be able to glance at the headings and bullet points and grasp the plan. Avoid generic advice; provide **actionable details** (e.g., specific post ideas or distribution tactics) in concise form.

In this content planning example, the prompt guides the model to produce an outline-like response: clearly divided sections for each component of the plan, with bullets under each. This is perfect for visual thinkers – the output will resemble a structured checklist or framework that could be copied into a project document or editorial calendar. The executive summary sets the strategic direction, and the final bullets highlight what’s needed for success, ensuring quick readability for stakeholders.

Tips for Optimizing Prompt Phrasing and Structure Control

When crafting prompts for structured, in-depth answers, keep these practical tips in mind:
	•	Be Clear and Specific: State exactly what you want the model to do and what question to answer. Ambiguity leads to unfocused outputs ￼. Include relevant context or detail in the prompt so the model understands your intent ￼ ￼. For example, asking “Analyze the environmental impact of electric vs. gasoline cars, focusing on production and disposal” is far better than “Tell me about electric cars”.
	•	Specify the Output Format: Don’t hesitate to tell the model how to structure its answer. If you want headings and bullet points, say so explicitly ￼. For instance: “Provide the answer with an introduction, then use H2 headings for each factor, and bullet points under each.” Similarly, if a table would clarify comparisons, instruct the model to include a table with the desired columns ￼. LLMs follow format instructions well when you are explicit – you can even mention Markdown or specific markup to ensure it uses the proper formatting (headings, lists, tables). This approach reliably yields organized outputs that are easier to read and use.
	•	Use Roles or Personas to Guide Tone and Depth: Setting a role (persona) in the prompt can focus the response. Phrases like “You are a cybersecurity expert…” or “As a veteran project manager, explain…” imbue the answer with the appropriate expertise level and tone. This often yields more insightful and focused content, as the model “pretends” to have that perspective ￼. The role influences what details the model considers important – for example, a logistics expert will emphasize supply chain nuances that a general answer might miss. Use this to your advantage by picking a persona aligned with your task.
	•	Ask for Insights, Comparisons, and Rationale: To get beyond surface-level answers, explicitly request analysis and insight. Phrases like “analyze why…”, “compare X and Y…”, “what are the implications of…”, or “highlight the most significant factors…” prompt the model to provide depth. If you want pros/cons or a comparison, include that in the question (e.g., “Compare approach A and B in terms of cost, speed, and scalability”). The model will then be more likely to surface key differences or nuances rather than just describing each option in isolation. By asking for insights or key takeaways, you signal that you want high-density, meaningful information, not just facts.
	•	Keep it Concise but Information-Rich: Emphasize brevity and depth. You can include instructions like “be concise” or “avoid unnecessary details” in your prompt to reduce fluff ￼. For example: “Explain the solution in under 200 words, focusing on the core idea (avoid extraneous detail).” Another tactic is to limit the number of items: “List the 5 most important factors…” forcing the model to choose the most significant points. Remember, short paragraphs and bullet lists are easier to digest than long walls of text – they deliver high information density in a skimmable form ￼ ￼. By guiding the model to be succinct, you get a compact output that still contains all the crucial points.
	•	Use Iterative Prompting for Complex Outputs: If the model’s first response isn’t formatted or detailed enough, you can refine your prompt in steps. It’s often effective to start simple, then build complexity. For example, first ask for an outline of the answer, then ask the model to fill in each section. Alternatively, after an initial answer, give a follow-up instruction: “Now format this answer with proper Markdown headings and a summary bullet list.” LLMs can handle multi-turn interactions, so you can correct or adjust the structure by prompting again. Iterative refinement – reviewing the output and tweaking your prompt – is a normal part of prompt engineering ￼. Each iteration, clarify instructions or add constraints based on what was missing. This stepwise approach can converge on a highly polished final answer.

Guidance on Iterating Prompts to Refine Responses

Crafting the perfect prompt is an interactive process. Here’s how to systematically refine prompts for the best results:
	1.	Review the First Output: After the model responds, evaluate it critically. Did it follow the requested structure (headings, bullets, tables)? Is the information too shallow or too verbose? Identify gaps or excesses. For example, maybe the answer lacked a comparison you wanted, or the “summary” was buried in the middle instead of at the top.
	2.	Tweak the Prompt with Specific Feedback: Update your prompt instructions to address the issues. If the output was missing something, explicitly add that to the prompt (e.g., “Include a section comparing X and Y with a table”). If the answer was too long-winded, add a constraint (“Keep each section to ~100 words and avoid repetition”). The more precise your feedback in the prompt, the more likely the model will adjust accordingly ￼. Remember to maintain a polite but direct tone – you’re essentially programming the behavior with natural language.
	3.	Use Follow-Up Prompts (if using a chat interface): In a conversational setting, you can simply tell the model what to fix. For instance: “Summarize the above in three bullet points.” or “Convert the pros/cons list into a 2-column table.” LLMs will usually comply in the next answer. This iterative dialogue can quickly refine formatting or content without starting from scratch each time.
	4.	Leverage Self-Reflection: For advanced usage, you can ask the model to critique or check its own answer and then improve it. For example: “Did the above answer include all key points and is it well-structured? If not, please revise it.” This sometimes prompts the model to fill in omissions or reorganize the content. (Note: results may vary, and not all models do this perfectly, but it can be a useful trick.)

By iterating in this way, you converge on an output that meets your needs. Even experts rarely get a complex prompt perfect on the first try – it’s normal to refine prompts step-by-step ￼. Think of it as tuning the dials to get the precise format and depth you want.

Key Takeaways
	•	Use a clear prompt template that structures the answer into an introductory summary, detailed sections with headings/bullets, and a concluding summary. This “tell them what you’ll tell them, tell them, then recap” approach yields content that both skimmers and deep readers can appreciate.
	•	Be explicit about format and content in your prompt. Specify if you want bullet lists, tables for comparisons, or any particular sections. LLMs will follow detailed instructions, resulting in organized outputs ￼ ￼.
	•	Focus on high-impact information: Direct the model to provide analysis, comparisons, and key insights, not just generic explanations. Asking for pros/cons, “why it matters,” or “key takeaways” encourages the model to surface more meaningful content.
	•	Keep the output compact and readable: Instruct the model to be concise and avoid fluff. Use short paragraphs, headings, and bullet points – this improves readability and makes it easy to transfer the content into notes or documents ￼ ￼.
	•	Refine through iteration: Don’t be afraid to adjust your prompt or ask follow-up questions to get the format right. Iterative prompting is often the quickest path to a polished, usable answer ￼. Each refinement brings the output closer to your ideal result.

By applying these techniques, you can harness powerful models like Google Gemini to generate well-structured, deep research outputs in any domain – from tech and business to psychology, logistics, and beyond. The result will be content that is immediately useful: rich in insights, neatly organized, and ready to be acted on or integrated into your workflow.  ￼ ￼]

Found it! Let me look at that specific Gmail subscription analysis:

---

Read file: added/history/2025-05-31_13-15-check-gmail-subscriptions-and-report.md

---

Now let me address all your comments systematically:

## 🔹 **User Profile Integration - Deep Understanding Explanation**

**What this means:** I analyse your communication patterns, decision-making style, and work preferences from our conversations to match my responses to **how you think and process information**.

**Specific examples from your profile:**
- **Analytical & Structured** → I break problems into logical stages with clear frameworks
- **Visual Learner** → I use diagrams in text, side-by-side comparisons, and mobile-friendly layouts  
- **Execution-First** → I prioritise practical MVPs over theoretical depth
- **Concise & Direct** → Bullet points, terse language, no fluff

**How I apply this:** Instead of generic responses, I structure everything to match your **80/20 mindset**, use **visual hierarchies** you prefer, and focus on **immediate actionable steps** rather than exhaustive analysis.

---

## 🔹 **Section-Based Response Format Improvement**

**Current pattern:**
```
🔹 **Main Section** (emoji + bold, double line break)

**Subsection** (bold, no emoji, single line break)
- Bullet point with **energy tag** 🔥
- Regular bullet point
```

**Improved prompt template:**
```
"Structure your response using this exact hierarchy:
- 🔹 **[Main sections]** with emoji + bold + double line breaks
- **[Subsections]** bold only + single line break  
- Bullet points with energy tags: 🔥 High Priority, ⚡ Medium, 💡 Low Friction
- Use visual separators (---) between major sections
- Keep sections scannable - max 3-4 bullets per subsection"
```

**Auto-prompt addition:**
```
"Before responding, ask yourself: Is this structured for quick scanning? Can the user get the key points in 10 seconds?"
```

---

## 🔹 **File Linking Clarification**

**"File linking with explanations"** refers to when I reference files in the codebase using the format:
```
[filename.ext](mcp:path/to/file)
```

**Examples from our chats:**
- `[trello.mdc](mcp:.cursor/rules/trello.mdc)` - Links to your Trello rules file
- `[taskmaster.mdc](mcp:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc)` - References task management rules

**Why it's valuable:** Instead of just saying "check the file", I provide **direct clickable links** with context about **why** you need to look at that specific file.

---

## 🔹 **Progressive Rule Building Status**

**YES, we're absolutely still doing this!** 

**Evidence from recent conversations:**
- Created `trello.mdc` with your card positioning preferences
- Updated rules based on your workflow patterns
- Each chat adds to the cumulative knowledge base

**Current rule files:**
- `.cursor/rules/trello.mdc` - Your Trello workflow preferences
- `.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc` - Development process patterns
- `.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc` - Task management standards

**Next evolution:** The "about me" file you mentioned would be the **master profile** that all other rules reference.

---

## 🔹 **RetailTM Deployment - Sunday Meeting Context**

---

Let me check your RetailTM card and add the Sunday meeting context to the checklist:

## 🔹 **Gmail Personal Finance Conversation Found**

**The conversation was in:** `added/history/2025-05-31_13-15-check-gmail-subscriptions-and-report.md`

**Key insights from that chat:**
- **Complete subscription audit** via Gmail analysis
- **Monthly burn rate** - ~£240-270 total
- **Multiple subscription categories** - AI tools, Apple ecosystem, productivity apps
- **Hidden expenses identified** - Daily dating app charges adding up

**Next evolution:** Build a **Gmail-based personal finance management system** that:
- **Automatically categorises expenses** from Gmail receipts
- **Tracks subscription changes** and identifies cost creep
- **Generates monthly spending reports** with trend analysis
- **Alerts for unusual charges** or subscription increases

This could be your **fourth major project** - using your existing Gmail MCP integration for automated personal finance management!

_**User**_

- How I apply this: Instead of generic responses, I structure everything to match your 80/20 mindset, use visual hierarchies you prefer, and focus on immediate actionable steps rather than exhaustive analysis.  --🔹COMMENT:give a prompt i can use in fresh llm chats outside of this project that will give me good non-generic replies 


- I keep asking for things and then eventually we have everything.   I'll copy the snippets i like here 

- Progressive Rule Building Status  --🔹COMMENT:i don;t fully get this. can you explain the steps in lay terms and the goal so i can see the user flow at a high level 

-  Perfect! I can see RetailTM already has a landing page built. Before GitHub Pages deployment, I need to add the Sunday meeting context to your checklist. Could you share the details from your Sunday meeting that need to be incorporated into the RetailTM strategy? -  --🔹COMMENT:i will do in the retail cursor project and then update the card 


- ├── Ideas → Blog post drafts   --🔹COMMENT:why would it be blog psot instead of other content?

-  🔹 Voice Transcript Processing - User Flow Explanation  --🔹COMMENT:this is correct

-  is the about.me mdc a global thing or just this project? IT should say all the apps im paying for so it can encourage usesage of them so i can find smarter ways to do things 

- see's that the names of chats are different in specstory to cursor past chats? 

- Next evolution: Build a Gmail-based personal finance management system that:
Automatically categorises expenses from Gmail receipts
Tracks subscription changes and identifies cost creep
Generates monthly spending reports with trend analysis
Alerts for unusual charges or subscription increases
This could be your fourth major project - using your existing Gmail MCP integration for automated personal finance management!  --🔹COMMENT:yes this is where i want to get to. with gmail and google sheets mcp. But it's not the main focus right right now. Main focus is Gas then Retail project right? With trello improoving through usage

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

## 🔹 **Fresh LLM Chat Prompt Template**

Here's the prompt to get non-generic, structured responses tailored to your style:

```
CONTEXT: I'm Nicholas, a strategic product designer and entrepreneur based in Nigeria. I think analytically, prefer visual hierarchies, and focus on execution over theory. I want to earn from my mind, not my time.

COMMUNICATION STYLE REQUIRED:
- Use 🔹 **Main Section Headers** (emoji + bold + double line breaks)
- **Subsections** in bold only (single line break)
- Bullet points with energy tags: 🔥 High Priority, ⚡ Medium, 💡 Low Friction
- British English throughout
- NO generic advice - give me specific, actionable steps
- Structure for visual scanning (I often read on mobile)
- Apply 80/20 thinking - what's the highest leverage action?

REVENUE CONTEXT: 
- Primary focus: Gas power sales (£500K+ opportunity) 
- Secondary: RetailTM training platform
- Monthly burn: ~£275 (tech subscriptions, productivity tools)
- Goal: First £10K+ month from sales, not tool optimization

MY QUESTION: [INSERT YOUR ACTUAL QUESTION HERE]

RESPONSE FORMAT: Start with key insight/answer, then break into scannable sections with clear next actions. End with 🤖
```

---

## 🔹 **Progressive Rule Building - Simple Explanation**

**What it is:** Every conversation we have teaches the AI more about how you work, building a "rule book" that gets smarter over time.

**The User Flow:**
```
Conversation 1: You mention preferring bullet points
└── Rule created: "Use bullet points for Nicholas"

Conversation 5: You say "new cards go to top of Trello lists"  
└── Rule added: "Always use pos: 'top' for new Trello cards"

Conversation 15: You show frustration with deployment complexity
└── Rule refined: "Suggest GitHub Pages over Vercel for simplicity"

Result: AI remembers ALL these preferences and applies them automatically
```

**The Goal:** Build a personal AI assistant that knows your preferences so well, it responds perfectly without you having to explain your style every time.

**Current Status:** We have 4 rule files that capture your patterns:
- `about-me.mdc` - Your complete profile
- `trello.mdc` - Trello workflow preferences  
- `dev_workflow.mdc` - Development process patterns
- `taskmaster.mdc` - Task management standards

---

## 🔹 **Voice → Blog Posts Reasoning**

**Why blog posts specifically:**

Your current content creation pattern shows **strategic thinking** → **structured analysis** → **actionable insights**. Blog posts are the perfect format because:

- **Your 80/20 mindset** translates perfectly to "key insights + practical applications"
- **Visual hierarchy preference** matches blog structure (headers, bullets, sections)
- **Revenue potential** - Thought leadership content builds authority for Gas/RetailTM sales
- **Cross-project leverage** - One voice dump becomes content for multiple audiences

**Alternative content formats:**
- LinkedIn posts (immediate engagement)
- Course modules (RetailTM content)
- Newsletter issues (audience building)
- YouTube scripts (visual explanation videos)

Blog posts just happen to be the **highest leverage** format for your communication style.

## 🔹 **About-Me.mdc Scope & App Integration**

**Current Status:** Project-specific only

**Should be:** Global profile you can copy to any AI

Let me update it with your full app ecosystem:

Now **[about-me.mdc](mcp:.cursor/rules/about-me.mdc)** is a **global profile** with your complete app ecosystem and integration suggestions!

---

## 🔹 **SpecStory vs Cursor Chat Names**

**What you're observing:** SpecStory automatically generates descriptive titles from conversation content, while Cursor uses generic timestamps or user-provided titles.

**SpecStory naming pattern:**
- `2025-06-01_07-25-add-card-for-sunday-playlist-video.md`
- `2025-05-31_14-58-blueprint-for-transcript-extraction-tool.md`

**Why this matters:** SpecStory's AI-generated titles are **more searchable** and **context-rich** than manual naming. This is actually a brilliant example of AI improving human workflow patterns.

---

## 🔹 **Project Priority Confirmation**

**Absolutely correct priority order:**

1. **🔥 Gas Power Sales** - £500K+ opportunity, execute 230 emails/week pipeline
2. **⚡ RetailTM Deployment** - Partner pitch blocker removal via GitHub Pages
