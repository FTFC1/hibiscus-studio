Okay, so this is just going to be a big thingy going through the Trello because there's a lot here. First of all, active project review, outcome priorities, info needed, completed, project ideas, parked.

So what I'll say on the Credit Corp one is simply that I need to send a message to Mr. Visayas, that's it. On the github hosting sites one, ah it was just that I saw that you could deploy a site for free, that was basically what it was. I think I'm actually going to get rid of that, it's a bit unnecessary.

This big Trello MCP dump, you'll see that it has attachments which like is partially something I want to be able to do so that each project maintains, um, like all of the transcripts that are to do with it or all the notes that are to do with it in one big note, so that when the MCP is learning about something I don't have to restart everything in terms of understanding the context of the project.

Um, now if I go to review, so it's not really the landing pages, that's not the that's just one part and the landing page I guess part of the thing for me right now is I want a landing page that's easy to spin up that we can put towards a domain now. Maybe the best thing that we could do is actually something using, um, yeah, so maybe the best thing we could do is actually something using a, I don't know, we could use Claude. I mean Claude Artifact is good enough. You just say it's a demo site, right, that means we don't have to do all the extra stuff, all of the other things.

This is a demo site, spin it up, boom, done. And then I think Claude Artifact would be a better one for that. Um, when we actually want to deploy something proper, I'll probably use YesCasa and then I want to try out DigitalOcean because that's what, um, this guy that I met was telling me about. Um, I don't know if you heard that but I said that the actual retail landing page will be done, the demo will be done let's say in Claude Artifact and then better than that will be done with YesCasa and then deployed in, um, using DigitalOcean.

And actually, where we are now is that we're doing interviews. I was supposed to do an interview today but I wasn't able to. But I can see that my partner has done two interviews already and I can see that the transcripts are in Otter and he shared them with me. So what that means is that I need to start processing these so that we can figure out how we want to collate the insights and then how those insights will be used to effectively, what, like, inform our training, inform our landing page, inform the pain points that we say that we understand about each of the clients and so on.

So next is the inventory. So this is about this concept actually that we're having around understanding how to deploy these, these tools that I'm building. I know my deployment just seems to take a really long time. I've repped it, it's very expensive, which I already said before. So I see that we have a vehicle deployment issue. I think that I should also have some way, like, use the same emoji or the card name to the thing that it's linked to.

In upcoming priorities we have this, like, traffic one for vehicle. So then on inventory tool we should also have the traffic or whatever it is, the road sign, so that the two can be visually brought together. The flower girl, so this FGCH flower girl, right, let's call it flower girl, but I feel like those four initials doesn't make sense and it's not going to be remembered.

The subscription and tools is actually quite interesting. I know you don't want it quite just because I now have access to an MCP letter, access to my email, and so I can actually get how much I've spent. This is the things that are coming x, y, and z. So maybe I could connect that by updating my MCP.

I think one of the things is that we need to have format, we need to have a format. So if I look, for example, if I look at the personal AI for me operating system, CoreVision with data sources, we have content strategy, content creation pipeline. You know what, this is actually good, I have no issues with this.

Okay, then we've got the MCP rebuild. So the issue that I have with this Trello MCP rebuild is that it's obviously not up to all of the conversations you and I have had should be feeding directly into this card, updating the checklist and updating the description and context.

Then we have this quick cards Trello with a label of tab. Essentially, this is like I was trying to do something where we're looking at how to just take all of my tabs and then associate them as natural to whatever it is with the right project.

We have 100 sessions, which is like, this is a concept. So there's something about content, I don't know, it's just like 100 capable sessions and 100 sessions of frantic piece of protein intake. That's what the 100 sessions are.

And then this monospace one, I'm gonna close because essentially that one's already done. I was just doing a demo, bank it out, what happened is that the founder is effectively ghosting me because I think he's a bit embarrassed about that. I don't know, he's embarrassed about the fact that he's an accountant, but he's still haven't gotten the act to be able to get them in a position to pay for the services, or they've just decided to push it ahead. Either way, I don't think it's too bad.

Although there's a bunch of new AI UI, it takes longer to do the UI. If I'm focusing on MCPs and the kind of stuff I'm doing right now, I guess I'll focus directly on building. So for example, I've made now this Trello MCP, which is what I'm using to do this. I don't know if I'm saying that in the same week products around this month.

I think at a certain point, I'll be able to build a wrapper, like a small UI wrapper. That small UI wrapper will then host the MCP and I'll have a whole product with relatively not that much front end.

This thing of getting my clothes, my clothes. What it is, is that I'm getting my clothes from my grandma's with the help of my cousin, Timmy. That's what grandma, is about. I'm just trying to clean up some things a little bit.

I was not saying that I should trim my nose hair or the gas cells. I think you confused that. That's wrong. It's about getting the business on.

You have this business plan creation. I'm just going to remove it because it's not correct.

The current issue with the whoop setup is that it looks like it needs, if I'm going to, if you're going to use it and use Stripe, then you need a UK number. I don't have access to my UK number right now. I'm hoping that I may be able to get it from my grandma's on Sunday. So we'll see from there.

Okay. This is the end of the voice chat.

before you begin always check the list to avoid any unesary creation of things that already exist or missed understanding of cards lcoations

_**Assistant**_

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀

Let me check the current Trello lists first to understand the structure before making any changes:

---



---



---



---



---

Now let me process your feedback systematically. I can see several issues and need to make corrections:

1. **Remove Business Plan Creation card** (you said it's not correct)
2. **Archive Monospace Partnership card** (already done, founder ghosting)
3. **Fix nose hair confusion** (was about business cards, not getting clothes)
4. **Update FGCH to "Flower Girl"**
5. **Visual consistency with emojis** between related cards
6. **Remove GitHub hosting sites card** (unnecessary)
7. **Update landing pages approach** (Claude Artifact for demos)
8. **Add Retail interview processing** (partner has done 2 interviews)
9. **Fix business card context** (about gas sales networking)

Let me start implementing these changes:

---



---

Now let me update the business card networking card description to clarify it's about getting business cards made:

---



---



---



---

Now let me update the Quick Cards for Trello card description to reflect the tab management concept:

---



---

Now let me remove the trim nose hair item from the wrong checklist:

---

the fisayo one was actually "Credicorp - Mr Fisayo" 

- we need to make a simple TRELLO RULES for you to always follow.: things like ending with break down of what you did ( less green tick emojis, the green is a lot )

---

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀

You're absolutely right! Let me fix that card name and create some Trello rules for consistency:

---
