11. **[16/07/2025, 14:48:17] FT Nico:** On the Acuity stuff. Message their support if you can’t see the issue. Those guys have access to the actual custom code. Sometimes it’s not a bug customer have access to solving

13. **[16/07/2025, 14:45:49] FT Nico:** 🔹 **Checking Current Event Hire Links on Website**  

Let me examine the current Acuity links on your website to see what's causing the errors:  
Ran tool  

Read file: current-june-28-2025/index.html  

🔹 **Found the Issue! Fixing Incorrect Event Hire Links**  

Perfect! I can see the problem. The website is using incorrect generic category links for the 4-hour, 6-hour, and 8-hour event hire instead of the specific appointment type IDs you provided.  

**Current Issues:**  
- **4 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`  
- **6 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`    
- **8 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`  

**Fixing with your correct links:**  

```bash  
git add current-june-28-2025/index.html hibiscus-studio-deploy/index.html && git commit -m "Fix Event Hire booking links: 4hr (80372609), 6hr (79362536), 8hr (80372722) - corrected from generic category links to specific appointment type IDs"  
```  

```bash  
git add current-june-28-2025/index.html && git commit -m "Fix Event Hire booking links: 4hr (80372609), 6hr (79362536), 8hr (80372722) - corrected from generic category links to specific appointment type IDs"  
```  

```bash  
cd hibiscus-studio-deploy && git add index.html && git commit -m "Fix Event Hire booking links: 4hr (80372609), 6hr (79362536), 8hr (80372722) - corrected from generic category links to specific appointment type IDs"  
```  

```bash  
git push && cd ..  
```  

```bash  
grep -A 2 -B 2 "4 Hours\|6 Hours\|8 Hours" current-june-28-2025/index.html  
```  

```bash  
grep -A 10 "4 Hours\|6 Hours\|8 Hours" current-june-28-2025/index.html | grep "openBookingModal"  
```  

🔹 **Event Hire Booking Links Fixed Successfully! ✅**  

Brilliant catch! I've identified and fixed the incorrect Acuity booking links. Here's what was wrong and what I've corrected:  

**🔹 Issues Found:**  
All three event hire options (4hr, 6hr, 8hr) were using incorrect generic category links instead of specific appointment type IDs.  

**🔹 Links Fixed:**  

| **Service** | **Old Link (Broken)** | **New Link (Correct)** |  
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------|  
| **4 Hours** | `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire` | `schedule/cb10d5fd/appointment/80372609?appointmentTypeIds%5B%5D=80372609` |  
| **6 Hours** | `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire` | `schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=79362536` |  
| **8 Hours** | `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire` | `schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=80372722` |  

**🔹 What I've Done:**  
1. ✅ Updated `current-june-28-2025/index.html` with correct links  
2. ✅ Updated `hibiscus-studio-deploy/index.html` with correct links  
3. ✅ Committed changes to both repositories  
4. ✅ Deployed changes to live site  

**🔹 Verification:**  
- 4 Hours: Now correctly links to appointment ID `80372609`   
- 6 Hours: Now correctly links to appointment ID `79362536`  
- 8 Hours: Now correctly links to appointment ID `80372722`  

The booking links should now work properly for all Event Hire options! 🤖 ‎<This message was edited>

14. **[16/07/2025, 14:42:39] FT Nico:** The entire webisite is custom. So the process was fixing the actual code and then deploying that new version on the internet.   

In a web builder it would be changing the link on their platform but this setup is different

15. **[16/07/2025, 14:41:05] Isaiah Dada:** Great the pages are back up and running now, thank you! Just out of curiosity how did you fix it? Would be helpful to know in case something like this happens again in the future.

🔹 **Quick Insights**
- Convo focuses on website fixes (booking links, Acuity integration), FAQ/T&C updates, and PDF requests.
- Latest exchanges are about clarifying additions to a price list PDF.
- If you need me to analyze patterns, summarize, or act on this (e.g., generate that PDF), just say—anticipating you might want to integrate this into Hibiscus Studio site/docs.
