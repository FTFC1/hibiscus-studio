# Discuss price increase details (2025-07-15 13:55Z)

_**User**_

We increased the prices by 45 gbp as you can see in the attached pdf. I now want to update the deployed site 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me analyze the user's request. They mentioned that they increased prices by 45 GBP and want to update the deployed site. Looking at the attached PDF, I can see it's a Hibiscus Studio price list and FAQ document.

First, let me understand the current structure by looking at the project layout:

1. There's a `current-june-28-2025/` folder with current website files
2. There's a `hibiscus-studio-deploy/` folder which seems to be the deployment folder
3. The PDF appears to be a price list update

Let me check the current pricing structure in the website files to understand what needs to be updated, and then update the deployment folder.

I should:
1. First look at the current pricing in the website files
2. Update the prices by adding 45 GBP to each service
3. Update the deployment folder
4. Possibly commit the changes as per the user's instructions

Let me start by examining the current website files to understand the pricing structure.</details></think>

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Examining Current Pricing Structure**

Let me check your current website files to understand the pricing structure that needs updating.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about updating the deployed site with the £45 price increase mentioned in the PDF. I need to find the current pricing in the website files and update them. Let me check the deployed site files first to understand the current structure.</details></think>

🔹 **Checking Current Pricing on Deployed Site**

Let me examine the current pricing structure in your deployed website:

```bash

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see the current pricing on the deployed site. Now I need to update all these prices by adding £45 to each. Let me also check the current version in the current-june-28-2025 folder to see if it's been updated there and then update the deployed version.

Current pricing I can see:
- £100 → £145
- £300 → £345  
- £420 → £465
- £600 → £645
- £840 → £885
- £60 → £105
- £45 → £90
- £250 → £295
- £500 → £545

And the range prices need updating too:
- £100 - £840 → £145 - £885
- £45 - £600 → £90 - £645

Let me check the current version first to see if it's already been updated.</details></think>

---

🔹 **Identifying Price Updates Needed**

Based on the current pricing, I need to add £45 to each price. Let me check if the current version has been updated:

---

```bash
cat current-june-28-2025/index.html | grep -i "£\|price" | head -20
```

```
<e-28-2025/index.html | grep -i "£\|price" | head -20
              <div class="text-sm font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">£100 - £840</div>
              <div class="text-sm font-medium text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-400">£45 - £600</div>
                  <div class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">£100</div>
                  <div class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">£300</div>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that both the current version and the deployed version have the same old pricing. I need to update both files with the new pricing (adding £45 to each price). Let me update the current version first and then copy it to the deployed version.

Let me update the prices:
- £100 → £145
- £300 → £345  
- £420 → £465
- £600 → £645
- £840 → £885
- £60 → £105
- £45 → £90
- £250 → £295
- £500 → £545

And the range prices:
- £100 - £840 → £145 - £885
- £45 - £600 → £90 - £645

I'll need to be careful and update all instances systematically.</details></think>

🔹 **Updating Pricing Structure**

Perfect! I need to update the pricing by adding £45 to each price. Let me update the current version first, then deploy it:

**Current prices → New prices:**
- £100 → £145

- £420 → £465
- £600 → £645
- £840 → £885
- £60 → £105
- £45 → £90
- £250 → £295
- £500 → £545

Did you change the links to acuity? on the site?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking if I changed the links to Acuity on the site. Looking at what I did, I only updated the pricing values - I didn't touch any links. Let me check what the Acuity links are in the current files and see if they need to be updated or if I missed something.

I should check for Acuity links in the files to see what they currently point to.</details></think>

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Checking Acuity Links**

Let me check the current Acuity links on your site to see if they need updating:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see that there are Acuity links in the deployed site. When I updated the pricing, I didn't change any of the Acuity links. The user is asking if I changed the links to Acuity, and the answer is no - I only updated the pricing values.

However, looking at the links, I notice they have specific appointment type IDs and calendar IDs. If the pricing changed, these Acuity appointment types might also need to be updated to reflect the new pricing structure within Acuity itself.

Let me check if the current version also has the same Acuity links to see if there's a discrepancy.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the Acuity links in both the current version and the deployed site, they appear to be identical. I didn't change any of the Acuity links when I updated the pricing - I only updated the price display values on the website.

The user is asking if I changed the links to Acuity, and the answer is no. However, this might be an important point - if the pricing has changed on the website, the corresponding appointment types in Acuity should also be updated to reflect the new pricing structure.

I should clarify this to the user.</details></think>

---

🔹 **No, I didn't change the Acuity links**

I only updated the pricing display values on your website (£100 → £145, etc.). The Acuity booking links remain exactly the same:

- All appointment type IDs are unchanged
- Calendar IDs remain the same  
- Booking URLs are identical

**🔹 Important:** You'll need to manually update the pricing in your Acuity account to match the new website prices:

**Current Acuity links point to:**
- `appointment/80164274` (Event Hire category)
- `appointment/79362536` (General booking)
- `appointment/79453733` (Workshop bookings)
- `appointment/80163988`, `80164478`, `80162472`, `80163518` (Various service types)

**Next steps:**
1. Log into your Acuity account
2. Update the pricing for each appointment type to reflect the £45 increase
3. Ensure the Acuity booking system shows the new prices (£145-£885 for events, £90-£645 for workshops, etc.)

The website will show the new prices, but customers will see the old prices when they click through to book unless you update Acuity as well! 🤖

_**User**_

So it would seem to me that for a event higher, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours, it says it is an error. 

Check against this

Event Hire: 

4 hour: @https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule/cb10d5fd/appointment/80372609?appointmentTypeIds%5B%5D=80372609 

6 hour: 
@https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=79362536 

8 hour: @https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=80372722

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying that for event hire, there are errors for 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours. They're providing the Acuity links for these appointment types.

Looking at the PDF they attached, I can see it's the price list document. Let me examine what they're saying about the errors and check against the current website.

They provided these links:
- 4 hour: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule/cb10d5fd/appointment/80372609?appointmentTypeIds%5B%5D=80372609
- 6 hour: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=79362536
- 8 hour: https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=80372722

I need to check the current website to see what links are being used and compare them to what the user is providing. The user seems to be saying there are errors in the links on the website.

Let me look at the current website to see what Acuity links are being used for these services.</details></think>

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

🔹 **Checking Current Event Hire Links on Website**

Let me examine the current Acuity links on your website to see what's causing the errors:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now let me look at the current website structure to understand which links correspond to which services. I can see from the grep results that there are many acuity links, but I need to identify specifically which ones are for 4 hour, 6 hour, and 8 hour event hire.

Let me check the current website structure to see the context around these links:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue! Looking at the current website:

1. **4 Hours** (£345) - using wrong link: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`
   - Should be: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule/cb10d5fd/appointment/80372609?appointmentTypeIds%5B%5D=80372609`

2. **6 Hours** (£465) - using wrong link: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`
   - Should be: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=79362536`

3. **8 Hours** (£645) - using wrong link: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`
   - Should be: `https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=35990507&appointmentType=80372722`

The issue is that the 4 hour, 6 hour, and 8 hour links are all using the wrong generic category link instead of the specific appointment type IDs.

Let me fix these links on both the current version and the deployed version.</details></think>

🔹 **Found the Issue! Fixing Incorrect Event Hire Links**

Perfect! I can see the problem. The website is using incorrect generic category links for the 4-hour, 6-hour, and 8-hour event hire instead of the specific appointment type IDs you provided.

**Current Issues:**
- **4 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`
- **6 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`  
- **8 Hours**: Using wrong generic link `owner=20490757&appointmentType=category:Event%20Hire`

**Fixing with your correct links:**
