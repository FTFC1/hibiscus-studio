# Boosting Cold Email Reply Rates (2025-05-22 23:01:19)

Can you make this into a no bs version straight to the point for me pls:

How to Get 6+% Reply Rates No Matter What ESP You’re Sending to - by mailr.io

VIDEO WALKTHROUGH


Among the greatest battles in history…..

David vs Goliath. 

Ali vs Frazier. 

Cold emailers vs email providers.

Email providers are actively doing everything they can to stop you from being successful with cold email.

It’s been harder than it ever has been to stay out of spam and get high response rates.

This guide will show you how to stay one step ahead of the email providers and stop settling for 1-2% reply rates.


WHY REPLY RATES ARE SO IMPORTANT

There are ONLY two ways to get more results in anything you do in business:

1. Volume
2. Efficiency 

You can either get better or do more.

Both work.

But becoming more efficient will allow you to get 5x the results when you do increase the volume.

So this doc is only talking about efficiency.

Now here’s why it’s so important.

The difference between a 1% and 4% reply rate could be the difference between an empty calendar and being packed out for weeks.

Say you send 20,000 emails a month.

You get a 1% reply rate.

20% positive reply rate.

30% book rate.

70% show rate.

20% close rate.

That’s 200 replies.

40 positive replies.

12 booked meetings.

8 live calls.

1 close.

Now if all else stays the same but you increase the reply rate to 4%:

800 replies.

160 positive replies.

48 booked meetings. 

33 live calls.

6 closes.


If you were to try improve any other metric to get to 6 closes a month, this is what you would need:

Positive reply rate - 75%

Book rate - 110%

Show rate - 250%

Close rate - 71%


This is why reply rates are by FAR the highest leverage and easiest to improve.

Increasing your reply rate by just 3% can 3-6x your business. 

And the best part is, it’s not that hard. 

Let’s break it down. 




WHO THE FUCK AM I TO SAY ANYTHING

First off, I’m no cold email guru.

We’re just some dudes who spend 8 hours a day doing/talking about/studying cold email.

We send over 50,000 cold emails a day and it’s the main acquisition channel of our business.

We have over 100 clients for our infrastructure sending over 1.5 million cold emails per day, averaging 4.2% reply rates.

We’ve consulted with dozens of cold emailers on how to increase deliverability.

We’ve studied how all of our top performing clients are able to get 6, 7, 8, even 10% reply rates consistently.

And we’ve had to reverse engineer all of this to make sure our infrastructure delivers at the highest rate possible.

Here’s some proof:







































Now enough about us, let’s dive in.


INFRATRUCTURE

There are two categories that affect your deliverability- the infrastructure and the campaign.

Both are important.

If you run a restaurant, the infrastructure is the power, the oven, the stove, etc.

The campaign is the ingredients, the recipes, etc.

You can be the greatest cold email copywriter in the world but if your infra sucks then it doesn’t matter.

This is the foundation.

For the sake of keeping this as actionable as possible, I’m not going to go into things like DKIM and DMARC and DFUCK. You know where to buy domains.

You’re better than that.

I’ll discuss what’s important:

Domain health
Servers


Domain Health

You know where to buy domains so I’m not going to talk about it. But I’ll mention a belief that was recently broken for me.

I was told .com domains deliver the best so that’s all I bought. After seeing thousands of campaigns get 6-10% reply rates with .info and .help, I’m convinced it no longer matters.

When it comes to domains, the only thing that matters is the domain health.

What does domain health really mean?

Domain health is another way of saying domain reputation.

Domain reputation is very self explanatory, but in a nutshell it’s how other ESP’s (Google, Microsoft, Proofpoint etc.) categorise your domain:

Poor domain health/rep = ESP’s have flagged your domain as a source of spam and therefore, your emails.
Good domain health/rep = ESP’s recognise your domain as safe/not a source of spam

Poor domain health means you’re gonna land in spam.

So what affects domain health?

Poor sending practices

Sending stupid numbers of emails from the 1 domain
Sending from spammy servers (low quality SMTP inboxes)
Shit copy
Bad data - resulting in irrelevant emails
Letting shit campaigns run for longer than they should
Rinsing the same lists too often
Recycle lists every 90 days, no sooner

Shit campaigns (not always your fault)

You can do everything right but have a shit campaign = damage to domain health
Low quality warmup pools
Some senders warmup pool is better than others. For example, Smartleads warmup pool is donkey ass. It often sends far too many warmup emails and will burn your reputation before you even start. 

Best practices:

If we know what causes a shit reputation, simply do the opposite.

Send proper amount of emails from your domain
Use high quality inboxes, Google or Outlook not SMTP
Use non-spammy copy
Take the time to find good leads and verify them properly
Not sending to the same list too often
Ensure you’re using a quality warmup pool

Domain Age

Based on what we’ve seen, the age of your domain won’t inherently get better reply rates out the gate compared to a new domain.

It can make a bit of a difference for sure, but it won’t be the difference between landing in the inbox and not. 

Why?

If you use new domains on good servers with proper sending practices, you’re still going to land in the inbox.

The benefit of aged domains is longevity. 

It’s harder for an aged domain to burn its reputation compared to a new domain, meaning they will stay healthy for longer.

If you’re strapped for cash, aged domains probably aren’t worth it.

But if you have the money to spend and you burn through domains quickly it’s probably worth it.


Servers

In regards to infrastructure there are really only two things that impact whether you land in the inbox:

Domain health
Server health

This is why SMTP inboxes have worse deliverability than Outlook and Google.

For example:

Imagine you want to send a package to your friend (but you don’t label the package or tell him):

You have two options for delivery:

1. There’s a big post office run by Microsoft or Google.

Your friend watches the truck pull up to deliver the package.

Microsoft and Google have branded trucks, packaging, and a good reputation, so he has some trust built.

He’ll probably feel safe to open it up.

2. You hire a stranger in a weird van to deliver it.

No branding or reputation.

Chances are your friend will think he just had a bomb delivered to him.

In short, it’s all about reputation. 

Servers have reputation and health just like domains which has a massive impact on deliverability.

When email providers receive an email, if the reputation is good they will let it in.

If the reputation is shaky then they won’t. 

Microsoft and Google are the two biggest ESP’s and have a rock solid reputation.

It’s impossible for you to ruin server health.

Which means:

Perfect deliverability out of the box
You can get away with lower warmup
Greater inbox longevity
Only have to worry about domain health


As opposed to private SMTP inboxes:

There are 1000s of server vendors that you can use to setup these inboxes
The main issue lies in their usage - it’s essentially zero, compared to google and microsoft which process billions of emails across the globe
Therefore when you spin up a new sending server it has a neutral reputation and it’s essentially unknown to the receiving servers 
This means you have to warm up for 30+ days to build the reputation of the server AND domain
But it’s pretty much a house of cards - 1 bad campaign and your domain and server are toast, so unless you have pre warmed servers you have to start all over again.

Note: If you want to use SMTP make sure you’re not using shared servers.

If one person on the server fucks around, everyone on the server finds out.


CAMPAIGNS

This is where the skill comes in.

If there is someone using the same infrastructure as you but getting way better results, it’s because they’re better at:

List building
Campaign set up
Copywriting
Follow up

The right infrastructure will get you in the inbox but this is what will actually get people to respond to you.

Getting all these in place is what will take your reply rates from 2-3% to 8-10%.

Again, this is not just high level fluff. 

This is everything that is working right now for the top cold emailers in the game.


What is Spam?

Before we dive into the how, it’s crucial to understand what spam really is. 

In our context, to put it simply, spam is simply irrelevancy.

The spam folder exists to protect you from scams and shit you don’t care about. 

Email providers spend MILLIONS making sure their users aren’t getting bombarded with shit they don’t want to see.

For you, that means you can’t just send the same shit that every cold email noob is sending. 

You have to be better.

The best way to be better is to be relevant. 

Sending to relevant people.

Using relevant copy. 

In other words, getting specific.

The more specific you are, the more likely the ESP filters will feel that your prospect wants to see your email.

Vectorization
Before a spam filter can flag your email, it has to "read" it. 
Since machines don’t speak English, they convert your message into numbers. 
That process is called vectorization.
Think of it like this: your email becomes a spreadsheet of word stats. 
Filters look for red flags like how often you say “free” or “buy now,” and compare that to patterns seen in past spam. 
There are different levels of this, from basic word counting (like tallying up “$$$”) to full-on AI models that understand tone, phrasing, and even intent.
The better you understand how your emails are being turned into data, the better you can write in a way that doesn’t trip alarms.
Best practices:
Avoid spam words (no more than five TOPS).
Run your copy through Email Guards spam filter.
Do not use the same phrasing or language that is commonly used in your industry. Get creative.
No dollar signs.
Avoid using AI unless you know exactly what you’re doing.

Lead List

If you want to be like everyone else, do what everyone else is doing. 

That means getting huge lists from Apollo and trying to win the volume game.

You’ll be able to send shit tons of volume but you won’t get the 10% reply rates you’re looking for.

To be exceptional, you have to put the work in that no one else is willing to do.

The best cold emailers I’ve seen aren’t the best copywriters, they’re the best list builders.

They find hyper-specific avatars from lead sources no one else thinks to look.

It’s more effort, but that’s why it works so well.

No one else is willing to put the work in.

If you are, then you’ll reap the rewards. 

Initial Research

Before finding the leads you need to know exactly what kind of leads you’re looking for. 

It’s not enough to target decision makers. What specific decision makers in your industry?

For example. 

If you’re targeting PE firms for lead generation, you can go after Business Development reps, Director of Strategy, Head of M&A, Associates, etc.

These guys would be more likely to reply than a CEO and they’re not getting bombarded with cold emails nearly as much.

Now go deeper.

What are their goals?
Problems?
Pain points?
Interests?
Tools they use?
Competitors?

Note that the problems and goals of a CEO are very different from a sales manager.

If you’re sending to a new industry, you can use our cheat sheet to help you build your avatar profile.

[MAKE COPY] - Dream Avatar Cheat Sheet
Customer Profile Generator Prompt

GPT prompt for finding industries to target + winning angles:

You are an expert marketing consultant and customer profile specialist with 20+ years of experience.


You excel in helping businesses identify new ideal customers
You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
You do not provide surface level insights that can easily be found online, you pride yourself in the depth of your expertise
You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
You have built multiple million dollar businesses
You have an IQ of 160
You focus on leverage points that create maximum impact 
You think in systems and root causes, not surface-level fixes

(if you already serve an industry and are looking to go upmarket use this below)

I currently serve ________ industry. My offer is __________. 

My goal is to go upmarket to increase my TAM and charge more premium pricing for the same services I currently offer.

Help me find industries that are upmarket of my current industry. 

Create a list of 5-10 to target. 

REQUIREMENTS:

Make sure they have similar problems that my services will solve.
Make sure to include the TAM of each additional industry. 
If possible, find industries that are underserved, meaning there are few competitors with similar offers. 

(if you are looking for a new industry to target)

My offer is ___________. (get specific)

Help me identify the top 10 industries that would benefit from my services.

REQUIREMENTS:

Must have a TAM of at least 600k. This can include adjacent industries, for example- marketing agencies + SEO agencies
Must be underserved. Find industries that not many other companies with similar services are targeting. 
My services must be a need, not a want.

PART 2:

Here’s your new task.

For each of these industries you’ve given me, give me the following:

Top 3 BIGGEST problems/painpoints each company has in regards to (whatever your service is). Remember, these are the problems the decision makers care about most and what keeps them up at night. The problems that are the highest leverage in their business. Focus on outcomes and benefits.
The top 3 outcomes each company desires around (what your offer does for them). 

REMEMBER: 

Be specific. This has to speak directly into their souls. They need to feel like I know exactly what they desire, like I’ve been spying on them.
Use the specific language that is used within these industries around (your service). 

Lead Sources

B2B Databases
Pitchbook
Sales Navigator
Zoominfo
Clay
Ocean
Crunchbase
Prequin
SaasyDB
G2
Capterra
Fintech Global
AngelList
Clutch.io
TweetScraper

Ecom
Store Leads
BrandNav
ShopRank

Cheeky
Serper.dev
Government databases
Ex. Review SEC filings to find newly registered entities 
Reddit
BuiltWith
TeamFluence
Scrapybird
Y Combinator


Sales Navigator will always be king in my opinion. 

Use Golden Leads to scrape.

Use Clay to enrich the leads.

Now if you’re using Apollo…

Most people just type in a fucken industry in Apollo, pull the list and call it a day.

What’s the issue? 

Apollo has a massive number of leads, but it’s data is not specific to your offer. 

The better way - is you do your “industry/segment search” somewhere else where it’s 100x more accurate and grab a hyper specific list of companies in your ICP and use Apollo to give you the leads from those companies.

You’ll get better leads and not miss any that don’t show up in Apollo.


Also, here is my guy for cheap Apollo lists

$6 per 10k

Tony - +8801762720867


Segmentation

If you want to scrape 100k leads and blast all of them with your offer then that’s great.

You’ll just be one of fifty thousand businesses doing the same thing.

The problem with this comes back to relevancy. 

There is no way that you can be hyper specific when you’re sending to this many people. 

Segmenting is what will allow you to speak to your EXACT avatar, using their lingo, tools they use, specific problems, competitors, etc.

It will make your prospects truly feel that you sat down and typed that email specifically for them.

What you can segment by:

Sub industry
Company size
Revenue
City
Behavioural data
Using/bought specific tech
Hit revenue milestone
Acquired a new company
Hired new CEO
Changed headquarters
Signed a large client
Started running ads
Liked a post on Linkedin 
Etc etc etc


Now you can incorporate these into your first lines and make the prospects feel you’ve done your research (which you have).

There’s a billion YT videos on how to use Clay to do this at scale so I’m not going to go into depth here. 

You’re smart.

Validation

Use OmniVerifier to verify.

It’s the cheapest and the best.

Use Clay to verify catch alls.

Most people don’t bother doing anything with catch alls because it takes more work.

You can add an extra 10-30% to your list by doing so.

And these are leads that are hit up less often.

Campaign Set Up

Straightforward. Follow our best practices guide for warmup and settings:

Cold Email Best Practices

COPY

Aside from the lead list, this is most important.

I’ll say it again-

The key is relevancy.

Get as specific as possible.

Example:

Is [COMPANY] able to take on more clients this quarter?

We help [INDUSTRY] companies get an additional 10-20 qualified appointments every month on a performance basis.

Care to chat?


Versus:


Saw you recently signed [COMPANY] as a client. Well done. 

We just helped [COMPANY] sign 4 deals just like this one last month, adding an additional 7 figs to their ARR.

Let me know if you’d like a free training on how we were able to do so.


Anatomy of a Good Cold Email

Personalization

The purpose of personalization is simply to make them feel that your email was sent specifically to them.

	This doesn’t mean you need to tell them their wife's maiden name. 

	Identifying a relevant pain point is often times enough.

Offer

	You don’t need a new offer, you need a better angle.

	In other words, your offer is not saturated. Your positioning is. 

	Find a way to position your offer that stands out from the rest.

	IMPORTANT: 

	Far too many offers are focused on features or benefits.

	The only thing people care about is the outcome.

What is the end result you’re getting your client that they would pay a premium for? Just talk about that.

The easiest way to avoid features and get to the core benefits is this simple copywriting trick.

Keep asking “so what?”

“We build AI agents that can connect to hundreds of different softwares and automate your business”

So what?

“So you don’t have to have employees doing every task themselves”

So what?

“So you can focus on revenue generating activities and save money by not having leads fall through the cracks and not have to hire, train, and manage tons of VA’s”

There we go.

Case Study/Social Proof

If you don’t have this then why should anyone believe you.

Of all the best performing campaigns I’ve seen, overwhelming majority include specific social proof.

Not “we helped another company book 30 calls.”

“We just helped [SPECIFIC COMPANY] add an additional 30 qualified appointments in just 17 days, adding 40k to their MRR.”

CTA

	The more simple the better. 

Make it easy for them to just reply “yes.”

	Not much else to say here. 

Also, only have ONE CTA.


Winning Angles

There are only three reasons people buy:

Save time
Make/save money
Freedom
Freedom of stress, headache, fat wife, etc.

You MUST identify what your avatar desires the most and include that in your copy.

It has to feel personal, like you know them on a deep level.

See the Chat GPT prompts and Dream Avatar Cheat Sheet to help you with this.

Now there are two angles you can take:

Problem focused
Outcome focused

The best copy touches on both.

When you bring up a problem, you have to get extremely specific and your solution must speak to that problem.

If the angle you decide to take doesn’t resonate personally, the solution won’t matter. 

“How many hours does your team spend sourcing leads?

We deliver 1000 custom leads per week that are scraped from databases your competitors don’t know about.”

Subject Lines

“Quick question” is getting way overused. 

Get more creative.

If your offer is relevant, you can just put it in the subject line.

This one helped me get 5% reply rates:

[NAME] - acquisitions?

Don’t overthink it. 

You’re not gonna track them anyway.


Copy

Different ESP’s have different rules.

What works for Google may not work for Outlook.

Google and other ESP’s are typically a lot more forgiving, but Outlook is a cunt (as of right now).

Follow good copy practices and you’ll be good for most, but here’s what to do for Outlook.

NOTE: You need to use these best practices when sending to Outlook, but overall if you use these for all of your campaigns, they will absolutely smack. 

I may as well call this “General Best Practices” but I digress. 

Sending to Microsoft

Outlook is a fickle bitch.

Microsofts AI can detect a cold email from a mile away and will make sure you go to spam.

If you sound like every other cold emailer you’re fucked.

Most people aren’t even sending to Outlook because it’s so hard to land in the inbox.

That means if you’re sending to enterprise companies, you’re missing out on 60-70% of your leads as most enterprise companies use Outlook.

Here’s the best practices from guys who get 6-10% reply rates from Outlook:

Shorter the better. Ideally around 25 words. 50 TOPS.
One line max.
Extremely casual and conversational. Like emailing a close friend.
No opt out. This immediately tells the filters that it’s a cold email. 
No spam words. Ok maybe just one, but that's it.
Indirect CTA’s

Example:

[NAME] - you guys actively looking for more companies to acquire? 

[NAME] - built a tool for you that helps you increase your CTR by 2%. Want me to send it?

[NAME], saw you use [TOOL]. We helped [COMPANY] get [RESULT] in just 23 days using [MECHANISM].

Interested?

[NAME] - if we could help you get faster funding for your next deal, is that something you’d wanna talk about?


FOLLOW UP

People who neglect follow up hate money. 

Plain and simple.

“The fortunes are in the follow ups” is a saying for a reason.

These are the stats from one of our recent campaigns.



30% of our interested replies came from one follow up message.

Here’s how to write follow up emails that actually convert:

Do not just hit them with a “just bumping this” or anything retarded like that.

Everyone and their dog says that.

People are so blind to these messages now that it doesn’t even register for them.

Get specific.

Expand on the original email.

Provide more social proof, bring up another angle, give more context.

This is ultra helpful if you are sending one liner emails (which are banging right now btw) as you’re not able to give as much context.

Example:

Email 1 - 

[NAME] - is [COMPANY] still looking for capital? We have a network of investors looking for deals in [SPECIFIC INDUSTRY].

Follow up - 

See the last email [NAME]? We just helped [COMPANY] raise 22M in 52 days after only speaking to 7 investors.

Let me know if this is worth a chat.


Troubleshooting Low Reply Rates

Every industry and offer is different, but in general a decent KPI to aim for is 1.5% reply rates.

If you’re getting less than this (or lower than you usually get with your offer) this is the order to find the issue:

List
	
	Are you sending to relevant people?

	Did you just pull a broad list from Apollo or did you get specific?

	Did you segment?

	Are you sending to catch alls?

Copy

	Did you use any spam words? 

	Was the email too many words? 

	Is the offer relevant?

	What angle did you use?

	Was it specific?

Domain Health

	The only way to tell domain health is from reply rates. 

	If you have a good list and good copy, it’s likely time to replace the domain.

Server

	If you’re using SMTP then are your servers cooked?

	If you’re using Outlook or Google servers this wont be an issue.


That’s all folks

Hope this helps

If you’re struggling with shitty deliverability

Poor reply rates

Sick of overpaying for inboxes

Sick of shitty customer support 

Try out mailr.io

# Cold Email: 6%+ Reply Rates - No BS Version

## Why Reply Rates Matter
**The maths:** 20k emails/month at 1% = 1 close. Same volume at 4% = 6 closes.
Reply rates are the highest leverage metric. Easier to improve than anything else.

## Infrastructure 

### Domains
- Domain extension doesn't matter (.com vs .info)
- Only domain health matters = reputation with ESPs
- **Don't burn domains:** Proper volume, good copy, quality data, recycle lists every 90 days
- Aged domains = harder to burn, but new domains work fine with proper practices

### Servers
**Use Google/Outlook inboxes, not SMTP**
- Perfect deliverability out the box
- No server reputation issues
- SMTP = neutral reputation, 30+ day warmup, house of cards

## Campaigns

### Lists (Most Important)
**Stop using broad Apollo lists. Get specific.**

**Lead Sources:**
- Sales Navigator + Golden Leads scraper
- Clay for enrichment  
- Use Apollo for contact data from your specific company lists, not discovery
- Verify with OmniVerifier + Clay for catch-alls

**Segmentation by:**
- Sub-industry, company size, revenue, location
- Behavioural triggers (new hire, funding, tech stack, etc.)

### Copy Rules

**Core principle: Be relevant and specific**

**For Outlook (enterprise):**
- 25 words max, 50 absolute limit
- One line only
- Casual like texting a mate
- No opt-out links
- No spam words
- Indirect CTAs

**Structure:**
1. **Personalisation** - make it feel personal
2. **Outcome-focused offer** - not features, just results
3. **Specific social proof** - "[Company X] got [specific result] in [timeframe]"
4. **Simple CTA** - "Interested?" or "Worth a chat?"

**Examples:**
- "[NAME] - you guys actively looking for more companies to acquire?"
- "[NAME] - built a tool that helps you increase CTR by 2%. Want me to send it?"

### Follow-ups
**30% of replies come from follow-ups**

Don't say "just bumping this" - expand with:
- More social proof
- Different angle  
- Additional context

## Troubleshooting Low Reply Rates
**Check in this order:**
1. **List** - Are they relevant? Segmented?
2. **Copy** - Spam words? Too long? Specific enough?
3. **Domain health** - If good list + copy = poor replies, burn domain
4. **Server** - Only issue if using SMTP

**Target:** 1.5%+ minimum, 4%+ with proper execution

## Key Spam Avoidance
- Max 5 spam words total
- No dollar signs
- Avoid common industry phrases
- Don't sound like every other cold emailer
- Run copy through spam filters

That's it. The difference between 1% and 6% is being more specific than everyone else who's blasting broad lists with generic copy.
