let's work to make a user flow then a PRD then we know what we actually wnat

Okay, great idea. Creating a user flow and then a PRD will give us a solid foundation.

To make sure we're on the same page, is this user flow and PRD for the **Automated Lead Generation system** we were discussing, potentially incorporating `spider.cloud`? Or is it for something else?

Once I know the focus, we can start mapping out the user journey.

🤖

_**User**_

It's for the Automated lead gen system. Spider cloud is an option for scarping.

Make two folders in @Documents one for what is currently there and one for new prd and user flows we'll be making

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Right then, let's get those documents organised. I'll create two new folders in your `Documents` directory:

1.  `Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1`: This will house all the existing markdown files related to the lead generation system.
2.  `Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v2_Planning`: This is where we'll create the new user flows and PRD.

I'll then move the existing documents into the `Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1` folder.

Here's the command I'll use to do this:


---

```bash
mkdir -p Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1 Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v2_Planning && mv Documents/AutomatedLeadGeneration.md Documents/ClientQualificationChecklist.md Documents/DataEnrichmentStrategy.md Documents/DealFlow.md Documents/ImplementationChecklist.md Documents/IterativeImplementationPlan.md Documents/KeyDeliverables.md Documents/LeadManagementSystem.md Documents/NewsMonitoringStrategy.md Documents/NigerianOutreachCulturalGuide.md Documents/RegulatoryNavigationGuide.md Documents/SimplifiedDataStructure.md Documents/TargetCompanyDatabase.md Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1/
```

```

Excellent, that's sorted.

Now, let's dive into the user flow for the Automated Lead Generation system.

To start, who is the primary **user** of this system? Is it you, a sales partner, or someone else? Understanding the user will help us define their goals and the steps they'll take.

Once we clarify the user, we can map out the flow from their perspective. For example:

*   **Trigger:** What starts the user's interaction with the system? (e.g., "I need new leads for X industry")
*   **Actions:** What steps does the user take? (e.g., "Run news scraper," "Review categorised companies," "Select companies for outreach")
*   **System Responses:** What does the system do at each step? (e.g., "Displays scraped articles," "Shows company profiles," "Generates draft emails")
*   **Goal:** What is the user trying to achieve? (e.g., "Send 10 personalised emails to qualified leads")

How does that sound?

🤖

_**User**_

- im the only user 
- I don't knwo how it starts we just want constant leads to sell generators to and we want a way to figure out that the person is more likely to buy. My idea was news but it's just an assumption 
- steps i thought of: scrape, score, show companoes, find details on cmapny, build lead list with detail, identify who to contact, research them for personalised first lines etc etc 

- Main goal: Send 10 perosnalised emails to qualified leads each week 

( we are iterating, expanding, THEN removing redundancy and refining till we have something in plain english that I like ) 


Alos i don't like the name "Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v2_Planning" or the other one. it's too long

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

No worries about the folder names, we can definitely make them snappier. How about:

*   `Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1`  ->  `Documents/LeadGen_Archive`
*   `Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v2_Planning`  ->  `Documents/LeadGen_Dev`

If you like these, I'll rename them.

Now, for the user flow – fantastic input! This gives us a strong starting point.

You're the user, looking for a constant stream of qualified leads for generator sales, aiming for 10 personalised emails weekly. The news was a good hypothesis for an initial trigger or data source for qualification.

Let's sketch out a first pass at this flow, keeping in mind our iterate-expand-refine approach. I'll create a new file called `user_flow_v1.md` in the (soon-to-be-renamed) `Documents/LeadGen_Dev` folder for this.

First, let's get those folders renamed.


---

```bash
mv Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v1 Documents/LeadGen_Archive && mv Documents/Automated_Lead_Gen_System_v2_Planning Documents/LeadGen_Dev
```

```

Okay, folders renamed!

Now, I'll create the initial user flow document.

```diff
- 
+ # User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v1)
+ 
+ **User:** Nicholas (System Owner/Operator)
+ 
+ **Primary Goal:** Send 10 highly personalised emails to qualified leads for generator sales each week.
+ 
+ **Assumptions:**
+ *   News articles can indicate a company's likelihood to purchase a generator.
+ *   The system can assist in identifying key decision-makers.
+ *   Personalisation significantly increases email effectiveness.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Phase 1: Lead Identification & Initial Qualification
+ 
+ **Trigger:** Weekly scheduled task / Manual initiation by Nicholas.
+ 
+ 1.  **Action (Nicholas/System):** Define/Update Search Parameters
+     *   **Details:** Specify keywords (e.g., "new factory Nigeria", "industrial expansion Lagos", "power outage business impact"), target industries, regions, company sizes.
+     *   **System:** Stores these parameters.
+ 
+ 2.  **Action (System):** Scrape News Sources
+     *   **Details:** Uses predefined (or `spider.cloud` integrated) scraper to gather articles based on search parameters.
+     *   **System:** Collects articles, extracts company names mentioned, article snippets, and source URLs. Stores raw data.
+ 
+ 3.  **Action (System):** Initial Article Filtering & Company Extraction
+     *   **Details:** Filters out irrelevant articles (e.g., duplicates, non-business news). Extracts potential company names.
+     *   **System:** Presents a list of articles and mentioned companies.
+ 
+ 4.  **Action (Nicholas):** Review Scraped Companies & Articles
+     *   **Details:** Nicholas quickly reviews the list. Marks companies as potentially relevant or irrelevant based on article context.
+     *   **System:** Updates company status (e.g., `potential_lead`, `irrelevant`).
+ 
+ ## Phase 2: Lead Enrichment & Deeper Qualification
+ 
+ 5.  **Action (System):** Company Profile Enrichment (for `potential_lead` companies)
+     *   **Details:** For companies marked as `potential_lead`, the system attempts to find more information:
+         *   Company Website
+         *   Industry
+         *   Location (HQ, relevant operational sites)
+         *   Basic company size/type (if available from public sources)
+     *   **System:** Populates a company profile. May use existing databases or online searches.
+ 
+ 6.  **Action (Nicholas):** Score & Prioritise Leads
+     *   **Details:** Nicholas reviews enriched profiles. Assigns a qualification score based on factors like:
+         *   Relevance of news (e.g., direct mention of power needs vs. general expansion)
+         *   Industry fit
+         *   Apparent need for a generator
+     *   **System:** Stores scores. Allows sorting/filtering by score.
+ 
+ ## Phase 3: Contact Identification & Personalisation
+ 
+ 7.  **Action (System/Nicholas):** Identify Key Contacts
+     *   **Details:** For high-priority leads, Nicholas (or the system, if capable via tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator API or other B2B databases) identifies relevant job titles (e.g., "Operations Manager", "Factory Director", "CEO", "Procurement Head").
+     *   **System:** Stores potential contact names and roles.
+ 
+ 8.  **Action (Nicholas):** Research Contacts for Personalisation
+     *   **Details:** Nicholas researches individuals (LinkedIn, company website) to find:
+         *   Specific responsibilities/achievements.
+         *   Recent company news they might be involved in.
+         *   Shared connections or interests.
+     *   **System:** Provides a space to note down personalisation points.
+ 
+ ## Phase 4: Outreach
+ 
+ 9.  **Action (Nicholas):** Draft Personalised Emails
+     *   **Details:** Nicholas uses the gathered information and personalisation points to draft unique emails. May use templates as a base but heavily customises the opening and value proposition.
+     *   **System:** Could offer email template suggestions or a "drafting pad."
+ 
+ 10. **Action (Nicholas):** Send Emails
+     *   **Details:** Sends the 10 emails.
+     *   **System:** Logs sent emails, date, and recipient (for tracking).
+ 
+ ## Phase 5: Tracking & Iteration (Future Consideration)
+ 
+ *   Track email opens/replies.
+ *   Log responses.
+ *   Refine scoring criteria based on successful conversions.
+ *   Update news scraping parameters based on effective lead sources.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ **Open Questions/Next Steps:**
+ *   How "automated" should contact identification be?
+ *   What specific news sources are most valuable?
+ *   What does the "scoring" mechanism look like in detail?
+ *   What tools/databases are available for company enrichment and contact finding?
+ *   Could `spider.cloud` also be used for company website scraping for details/contacts if initial news scraping doesn't yield enough? 
```

Done. I've created `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v1.md` with that initial sketch.

Have a look and let me know your thoughts. We can refine this, add more detail, or change direction completely. The "Open Questions" at the end are also good points for us to discuss to flesh this out.

What's your initial reaction? What feels right, what's missing, or what should we change?

Vibe 2: How to Book 300-500+ Calls per Month With Cold Email - by mailr
How to Book 300-500+ Calls per Month With Cold Email - by mailr.io


VIDEO WALKTHROUGH


I do not consider myself a cold email expert.


I also suck at copywriting.


But our firm is still able to book 300-500 calls per month from cold email.


That means if my dumb ass can do it, you can for sure do it.


Here is a screenshot of my calendar from just a couple months ago (at the time this is posted we’ve scaled back to focus more on mailr.io):







If you feel you’re good at list building and copywriting but still not able to flood your calendar.


Or you’re wondering why other companies are able to scale to hundreds of thousands a month strictly using cold email.


This is for you.



THE SECRET

You’ve probably seen guys who have the exact same service as you book ten times the number of calls that you do.


No, it’s not because they are copywriting gods or because they're better looking than you.


Booking 300+ calls a month is much simpler than you may think.


After sending millions of emails myself, booking thousands of calls, and studying some of the top performers in the cold email space, I’ve noticed a few things in common among guys who can book as many calls as they please:


High TAM
Message-Market Fit
Unique Positioning

You can boil it down to this; in order to book an absurd amount of calls you need to have enough of the right people to contact with an offer that either a) isn’t serviced in your target industry or b) stands out from the rest.


And the best part.


You don’t have to break the bank to get the same results.


I’ll break down exactly how to get so many replies your head will spin.


But before I do, I want to mention that this document is not going to go into copy, list building, reply rates, etc.


Lots of guys excel at these things but still aren’t able to book enough calls to scale.


I’ll be giving you the absolute fundamentals you need to be able to book 300+ calls a month from cold email.


Great copy and list building will just add fuel to the fire.


For an in depth guide on how to get 6% reply rates from your campaigns, check out this doc below.


How to Get 6+% Reply Rates No Matter What ESP You’re Sending to - by mailr.io


THE MATH

Let’s say you’re decent at cold email.


3% reply rates


20% positive reply rates


30% book rates


In order for you to book 300 calls per month, you would need to send 170,000 emails.


That’s 5100 replies.


1020 positive replies.


306 booked meetings.


That’s only about 7700 emails per weekday.


That’s nothing.


If you think that’s a lot of emails, that’s why your competitors are lapping you.


With mailr.io this would cost you just $960 a month.


That’s $3.20 per booked call.


Do the math on what it would cost you to send 170K+ emails a month with your current provider.


But wait wait wait, hold up.


What if you only get 2% reply rates, 10% positive reply rates, and 20% book rates?


Math.


1500 positive replies


15,000 replies


750,000 sends per month


30,000 sends per weekday


With mailr.io that would cost you $3600 a month.


Still only $12 per booked call.


If your package is $5000 let’s look at the ROI if we’re ultra conservative:


300 booked calls


50% show


150 live calls


10% close rate


15 closed


75k cash collected.


Not bad.


Here’s the point,


Being great at cold email and getting 10% reply rates is obviously amazing but you do not have to have these results to book a fuck ton of calls and make a fuck ton of money.


Volume makes up for a lot.


The beauty of cold email is that it’s relatively inexpensive.


Just run the math, look at the numbers, and be objective.


TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET (TAM)

The biggest reason most people aren’t able to send enough volume to be able to book 300+ calls a month is because your target industry isn’t big enough.


Simple as that.


If you’re targeting an industry where your TAM is only 50k, you’ll run through your whole list in less than a month.


That might be ok for some of you, but this is for people who want to book a ridiculous amount of calls to scale to seven figures.


If you want to send at least 200k emails a month, you need to have a TAM of at least 600k.


If you want to send 1M emails a month, you need a TAM of 3M.


You can rinse the list and hit them again every three months.


Some common industries with a TAM of over 600k:


SaaS
Fintech
Healthcare
Real estate
Education tech
HR
Legal tech
Insurance
Hospitality and tourism
And a fuck ton more you can find with a Google search

Now some of you may be thinking that you are already servicing an industry with a low TAM and you’re too deep to just switch.


There’s two ways to increase your TAM without changing your services or avatar:


Vertical expansion
Horizontal expansion

Vertical Expansion

This simply means going up (or down) market.


You typically don’t want to go downmarket for a million reasons so I’m only going to talk about going upmarket.


Even if your industry has a high enough TAM, you should go upmarket anyway.


These clients have more money to spend, are less of a headache, and have less people targeting them.


Some examples of going upmarket:


Real Estate Agents → Real Estate Brokers → Real Estate Developers → Property Management Companies


Health Insurance Brokers → Life Insurance Brokers → Property & Casualty Insurance → Employee Benefits & HR Solutions


General Contractors → Subcontractors (Electricians, Plumbers, etc.) → Building Materials Suppliers → Architectural and Design Firms


Ecom → Online Retailers → Wholesalers/Distributors → Private Label Manufacturing → Marketplace Aggregators


Single-Brand Retail Stores → Multi-Brand E-commerce Platforms → Wholesale Distributors → Franchise Networks


Horizontal Expansion

Rather than going up or down market, you go after industries adjacent to your target market.


Oftentimes you’ll be able to provide the same services as these companies typically have similar operations, problems, etc.


Some examples of of horizontal expansion:


Real Estate Agents → Property Appraisers → Mortgage Brokers → Home Staging Services


SaaS → CRM Providers → Email Marketing Platforms → Project Management Tools → Customer Support Software


Lead Generation Agencies → SEO Agencies → Content Marketing Agencies → Social Media Marketing Agencies


Health Insurance Brokers → Auto Insurance Brokers → Homeowners Insurance Brokers → Life Insurance Brokers


General Contractors → Electrical Contractors → Plumbing Contractors → Roofing Contractors


Cybersecurity → Endpoint Security Providers → Network Security Providers → Cloud Security Providers → Identity & Access Management Providers

MESSAGE-MARKET FIT

This is a new term that’s been going around and it’s ridiculously important.


Product-market fit is making sure your product or service is needed.


Once you have that (and I’m just going to assume you do), you need to find the right messaging that aligns with your target market.


Each industry has its own specific language even though they have the same problems.


If you expand vertically or horizontally to increase your TAM, you can’t just send the exact same emails to everyone.


You need to find the right angles to leverage for each industry to find the right messaging that will perform the best.


The only way to find this is through testing.


How to Find MMF

First, send a thank you to Sam Altman.


Go on Chat GPT and give it this prompt:

You are an expert marketing consultant and customer profile specialist with 20+ years of experience.

You excel in helping businesses identify new ideal customers
You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
You do not provide surface level insights that can easily be found online, you pride yourself in the depth of your expertise
You have deep expertise in psychology, strategy, and execution
You have built multiple million dollar businesses
You have an IQ of 160
You focus on leverage points that create maximum impact
You think in systems and root causes, not surface-level fixes

(if you already serve an industry and are looking to go upmarket use this below)


I currently serve ________ industry. My offer is __________.


My goal is to go upmarket to increase my TAM and charge more premium pricing for the same services I currently offer.


Help me find industries that are upmarket of my current industry.


Create a list of 5-10 to target.


REQUIREMENTS:


Make sure they have similar problems that my services will solve.
Make sure to include the TAM of each additional industry.
If possible, find industries that are underserved, meaning there are few competitors with similar offers.

(if you are looking for a new industry to target)


My offer is ___________. (get specific)


Help me identify the top 10 industries that would benefit from my services.


REQUIREMENTS:


Must have a TAM of at least 600k. This can include adjacent industries, for example- marketing agencies + SEO agencies
Must be underserved. Find industries that not many other companies with similar services are targeting.
My services must be a need, not a want.

Now that you’ve increased your TAM and have 5-10 industries to test, you need to find the angles to run.


Here’s the prompt for GPT:


Here’s your new task.


For each of these industries you’ve given me, give me the following:


Top 3 BIGGEST problems/painpoints each company has in regards to (whatever your service is). Remember, these are the problems the decision makers care about most and what keeps them up at night. The problems that are the highest leverage in their business. Focus on outcomes and benefits.
The top 3 outcomes each company desires around (what your offer does for them).

REMEMBER:


Be specific. This has to speak directly into their souls. They need to feel like I know exactly what they desire, like I’ve been spying on them.
Use the specific language that is used within these industries around (your service).

Now you have six angles for each avatar to test.


Use this cheat sheet to help you build the avatar profiles.


[MAKE COPY] - Dream Avatar Cheat Sheet


Positioning Your Offer

The best offers aren’t brand new, never seen before.


They are unique variations on the same shit everyone is already selling.


If a market is saturated that means there is a need for it.


You just need to stand out.


I’m going to say this again but more direct.


POSITIONING IS EVERYTHING.


At this point you know who to target, you have the problems and goals of your avatars, now you just need to position yourself correctly.


This is one of the most underrated aspects of cold email that separates the good from the great.


Good businesses use tactics.


Guarantees, performance pricing, scarcity, urgency, etc.


Great businesses use their positioning to increase their own value.


Here’s some simple examples of using your positioning to increase your value in the eyes of the client:

Lead generation → Growth partner


Automations → AI agent → Infrastructure kasufw


Copywriter → Conversion specialist


In regards to your angles, keep in mind:


Focus on the benefits, not the deliverables.

Far too many people are unintentionally grouping themselves in with every other agency.


“We do cold email”


“We’ll run your ads”


“We’ll automate your business”


People only care about the outcome.


They DO NOT care how they get there.


If I told you I would give you a million dollars if you could run a mile in 6 minutes…


And I told you to choose between Nike shoes and Adidas.


Would you give a fuck?


No.


If you could book a company 50 calls a month through carrier pigeon, they would pay you.


Position for high paying clients, not broke people.

“We’ll book you 30 calls next month guaranteed or you don’t pay.”


Who is that more likely to attract?


A company doing $400k a month willing to pay a premium or an agency owner who needs to make money this month to pay for all his software?


Separating yourself from the competition does not mean creating a bigger promise.


Everyone has seen them before.


Separating yourself means solving a specific problem for your industry using messaging that is unique.


You stand out by speaking their language, by having them feel like you know exactly what they want and how to get it done.


And the reason this works is because it’s hard.


No one does this.


It’s much easier to slap on a ridiculous guarantee than it is to research your customer thoroughly.


Important

Changing how you’re positioned in the marketplace is changing how you’re seen.


In order for clients to see you differently, you must see yourself differently.


You cannot fake this.


This requires an identity shift for you and your business.


This is one of the most important things I can stress.


You cannot fake your way into better positioning, you have to believe it yourself.


I did a rant on this because I can’t stress how important this is, you can find it here.


How to Test MMF

Chat GPT is great but the only way to tell if you found messaging that sticks is if you test it and get feedback.


You’ll know you have a winning angle when you get a ton of booked calls.


So to get feedback quickly, you need to have volume.


If you test with 200 emails a day, you’ll have to wait at least a week to be able to tell if you found the winning angle.


I like to send minimum 2000 a day when I’m testing so I’ll know within a couple days which angle is the winner and I can 5x the volume immediately.


The other angles you haven’t tested you can use in 3-6 months when you hit the leads again.


Here’s the step by step:


Create a campaign and split test with the three best angles you believe are most likely to convert.
Send 2000-4000 emails with 50/50 new sends and follow up.
See which angle performs the best.
Double down on the winning angle.
If none of the angles hit your KPI’s, rinse and repeat step 1.


With this strategy you’ll be able to test angles and launch winning campaigns faster than all of your competitors and get faster results for your clients.

(643) THIS Guy Built A $105k/m AI Agency With Zero Technical Skills - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BQV-disJEg

Transcript:
(00:00) You need to shift that paradigm of failure because failure does not exist. Yeah. It's a temporary state of being. It is not a label or identity. You know that feeling when you first get your first payment from the internet. It just changes everything. I've never had a better feeling after that. Instead of looking at the system, just looking at the features, look at it in another view.
(00:20) Will this get my clients more customers? Will this make me more money? I mean, lead genen is just the bottleneck in 99% of cases. from 0 to 10k. The same principle that worked at first, like the same task that you've done to get the first clients, just keep doing them. You want to squeeze as much juice from the thing that's working before you move to another thing.
(00:36) You know, here's how one of my earliest community members started from scratch and now makes over $105,000 per month recurring with his AI and automation business. Mr. Sad Belcade, how you doing today? Doing great, man. How you doing? Fantastic. Thank you very much. Really looking forward to having this call with you for a while.
(00:54) So, I'm glad that we managed to put something on paper, make it happen. Yeah. And it's always nice to chat with my good friend Nick. Good friend now. Very presumptive of you. Yeah. I'm just busting your balls. So, I got a bunch of questions I wanted to run you through. I know you've had some pretty massive business success over the course of the last few months.
(01:13) I thought it'd be worthwhile for you to share that with some of the people that might be on the fence about getting started with their own AI automation agency. And this is going to be pretty casual. We're just going to chat back and forth. Um, I think there's just a lot of interest in what an actual journey looks like these days. Sound good? Yeah, sounds great.
(01:29) All right, hit me. How much did you make last month with your automation business? So, I've made 105K and it was at 90% margins. Yeah. 90% margins on 105K. I had to throw that at the end, obviously. Yeah, that's incredible, man. Holy. So, you're already at the six figure monthly mark. Yeah.
(01:51) How much were you making a year ago? Do you remember? A year less than 1K. Yeah. Dang. Well, that is definitely some growth. Yeah, it's crazy. What were you doing before you started all this stuff, son? Before I started my automation agency, I was actually a nightclub bouncer for about 2 years, you know.
(02:09) So, I was basically just punching people for a living. That's the best way to just That's the best way to just explain it. Yeah, I was a nightclub bouncer. I was working from Monday to Friday basically. And during that time uh I wanted to learn how to code right and I quickly realized that most of developers and you know these software engineers like a lot of them are equipped by the skills and knowledge but they don't necessarily make a ton of money.
(02:35) Like the difference between like no code tools and programming is that the lines of codes are boring to look at right and especially when you want to show that to like a prospect they don't necessarily understand the value out of it. But when you show like a mig.com or like an NA10 flow, right, it's more visual so they understand the value of the entire automation.
(02:55) I came across your channel and I I just realized that there are always better ways to do things. I just went the rabbit hole of just AI and automation. I just fell in love with it and I just became obsessed with it. I think around the time we started talking, I think I sent you like an email back then and I specifically remember this tweet you posted and I said, "When are you going to put up a course so I can help you close some grandmas?" I think I still have that screenshot. I remember that.
(03:21) That was that. Yeah. Good times, man. Wow. That's um that's crazy to think about. Yeah. So, if I'm okay, so if I'm getting this correctly, sort of like 9 to5ish bouncing, obviously the bouncing equivalent at night. you wanted to figure out how to code because you probably saw Yeah, I wanted to learn how to code. Yeah.
(03:39) But it was probably very difficult for you to like demonstrate the value of this stuff cuz it was all just scripts and then you started looking into AI and automations. You you probably heard some people were making some money with this and you're like what's different about it? And you realize that it was mostly the visual nature.
(03:55) The fact that like the systems that you build in no code are more maintainable. They're more visual. Clients typically value these things. Yeah. At least as much as code if not much more. Yeah. Yeah, and I think we both agree on this is that the systems that we build are real life systems, right? Prospects when they see the systems, they can see the outcomes, right? Cuz I, you know, when I first got started, I had this idea like I want to automate everything, you know, but it just doesn't make sense.
(04:18) There are things that are worth automating, other things that are not. For sure. Yeah. I go as far as to say like the vast majority of things that most newbies and beginners want to automate, it's like nope. No real reason for that. Yeah. I mean, if you look if you if you go to YouTube right now, there's a bunch of channels that show you systems, but does it really like actually move the needle, you know? Yeah, for sure. I feel you.
(04:39) If we could talk tactically, what's the strategy that you followed? Yeah, that's a really good question. Yeah, I think the main thing that enabled me to achieve success is basically just doing things that don't scale, right? M the principle that I took from one of the best people that I admire, which is Paul Graham, doing things that don't seem shiny at the beginning, right? But these things that you're going to be doing are going to be like the main drive of your success later on.
(05:06) The tactics for me when I first got started is basically outreach. Like it was the main thing. Even highle people, they they do some sort of outreach every single day, right? It could be like anything like content, creating content, uh, cold email systems, some sort of like Upwork outreach or something, you know, it's always there because I think the main bottleneck of anyone that wants to make money is pipeline.
(05:27) I think we both agree on this. Yeah%. I think even if you are 40k a month, like the main bottleneck is going to be pipeline because I mean, if you don't do any hours, you're not going to get clients. If you don't get clients, maybe you're not making any money, right? 100%. It's as simple as that. I'm on record multiple times saying that if you don't have clients, you have a hobby, right? Not a not a company, not a business.
(05:47) Yeah, this is really funny actually because it reminds me of a story. Okay, I remember I was on my first sales call with this marketing agency and it was a lady and I said, "How are you guys currently generating leads?" And she said, "Oh, we do this through our folds." And like I just said this like I did not intend any harm or anything but I just said well you guys don't have a business and it was like it was such a I didn't say it in a way that's like oh you guys don't have a business you know it was very genuine you know and she got really pissed. She
(06:20) got really pissed during the sad yeah she got she wanted to she wanted to kill me you know you don't have a business says this young 20-year-old to this The fun part is that Yeah. But uh the crazy part is I actually ended up closing that deal. I really wanted Oh, dude. That's so cool, man. So, you flipped it from her being like super pissed off at you essentially to That's really cool, man. Wow. Damn, man.
(06:45) What a wild story. In terms of the specific sorts of outreach you did. I imagine most of it was cold email. Yeah. Okay. It was mostly cold email. Yeah. Blasted out the cold emails. when I tried to sell automation, right? I noticed that most people or most businesses like they always wanted to get more customers and what is the cheapest way to acquire customers called email, right? It's like 10 to 15 times cheaper than any paperclip ads or any referral scheme.
(07:12) It's the cheapest way to get clients. You know, you can literally like start a campaign in like a few hours, right? Literally just get domains like get pre-wormed. I mean, not to get technical, but it's the easiest way to do it, you know, and now that we have AI and automation, it just makes it even easier. For sure. Makes perfect sense.
(07:30) So, I actually tried running a bunch of PPC way back in the day when I was launching um my I hate ads, man. Dude, they're terrible. Well, here's the thing, man. I hate them. It's it's it's not that they're terrible. It's just a consequence of the sorts of businesses that were running. Okay. for like service-based agency businesses, the the cost per meetings, in my humble opinion, are just too high unless you have some really cool take on the whole thing.
(07:50) And you can have really cool takes on the whole thing. I just I've never really been good at finding that. So, just like you um you know, I I started my whole thing with Outreach as well. I mean, this is a while back with doornocking and whatnot that and and that eventually converted into cold emails, but I just found like cold emails so much more reliable, so much more straightforward.
(08:07) And then like when you put yourself in front of them, you're just like you're just a person and then they're just a person. It's just like, "Hey man, here's some cool stuff. Do you want it?" You know, that's the pitch. Yeah. I had like a couple people telling me like, "You should run ads for your agency, etc.
(08:20) " And I think it's also like a limiting belief like because I grew up watching ads and I just can sniff out the  It just doesn't make sense, you know? Yeah, I feel you, dude. I'm right there with you. I've seen so many like too good to be true ads. You jumped super far into the deep end, cold emails. Did you target any niches? Did you just like spray and pray? What was the strategy initially? Obviously, at first you want to talk to everyone.
(08:43) You know, it just doesn't make sense to niche down when you you don't have any clients cuz I see this issue with many people is like I want to target this exact niche and I want to do this big 20 document research. Just doesn't make sense, you know. You want to talk to everyone, especially when you first get started, you know.
(08:59) So, my first campaign was actually in the room. Yeah. And that was one of the best campaigns I've ran, right? before I ran like it cyber security but I didn't get that many good replies I didn't get that many book meetings I noticed that recruitment at that time and even like a lot of people that I know now are still targeting recruitment they're getting like really good results they have like a very clear offer right what they want to do like recruitment just they want to place candidates so they want to place if you can just help them place a couple
(09:26) candidates and typically they earn like 20 30% commission of each placement you can collect like 3k 4k easy you know if you just place one or two you No. Uh when you say this, you're saying like revenue share on the placement. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. So let's say like I don't know if they're placing 100k a year candidate, they make 20% and then for example, for example, there's like a software developer that they have in house and they typically make like 120k a year, right? Mhm.
(09:54) So they get like 20 30% commission if they place that candidate and you can make like 2 to 3k, right? Which is pretty good. And the cool part about recruitment is it's also really easy to fulfill, you know, which I think the main hurdle for scaling is not getting people results, right? Yeah, for sure. When you're growing, everything is fine.
(10:11) Yeah, it's so easy to fulfill just because there's multiple ways to find companies hiring, which is basically just scraping job boards. H yes, like uh Indeed, LinkedIn, that sort of stuff. Um yeah, there's a couple ways like you can scrape like LinkedIn, like there's other platforms like Wellound, Indeed.
(10:28) you can just find companies hiring for those exact roles and you're basically just connected to, right? That's really interesting. Um, conceptualizing your work as just a connector between people that are looking for roles and then Mhm. makes sense, dude. I like the scalability of like a percentage revenue share approach.
(10:44) Um, I think that's really cool. Did you take on any risk initially when you did this the first few times? Like did you start doing percentage revenue share or did you start doing like flat and then eventually you're like, "Wait a second, I can make a ton of money if I pull the upside." First I didn't have the confidence to to ask for it. Yeah, it makes perfect sense.
(10:57) first client I worked purely on performance, you know, and I overd delivered and then I just pushed hard for retainer and I got them locked in in like a three-month retainer and I think that snowballed after because just you know when you get that first client you have that cash so you can essentially just invest it in your campaign always having a campaign running in the background because I guess like a lot of people like they would start a campaign they get their first clients and then they basically just stop their campaign and just put
(11:25) all this time and energy and fulfillment, right? Which is definitely like the wrong thing to do, right? I would also handle like fulfillment just later in evenings once I finish my ROI tasks, which is always going to be some sort of outreach, some sort of follow-ups with people, right? And making sure my inbox is like cleared, you know, 100%.
(11:44) I think a lot of people just don't understand that lead genen solves everything. If you are a der of clients, lead genen solves that, right? Cuz you increases the top of funnel. If you have too many clients and you can't manage your projects, well, lead genen solves that because now you have more abundance.
(11:59) So, you could pick the higher paying contracts for the next run. Yeah. I mean, lead genen is just the honestly bottleneck in 99% of cases. And it sounds like the main difference between you and some of the people that have attempted probably a similar business model but haven't had as much success is you just knew that immediately and then it sounds like you also reinvested pretty pretty heavily.
(12:16) Like a lot of people just don't reinvest because they're afraid. I mean, they security scarcity, right? they make a little bit of money and then they're like, "Hell yeah, I have a little bit of money now. I'm going to hold on to it." But if you have something that's working and delivering you like a 15x ROI, doesn't it just make sense to like invest all of it? I mean, that's, you know, capital.
(12:33) That's literally how capitalism works, right? You know that feeling when you first get your first payment from the internet? It just changes everything, right? I've never had a better feeling after that. That's awesome. The next few after that, like, yeah, I don't know. Payment. Um, definitely.
(12:49) You still get that dopamine hit the ching sound. Uh but uh it's definitely not the same when you're first getting started. I always tell this to people. Your first 10K is going to be the feeling where you're going to feel rich. That's it. After that, it's just numbers in the screen. After that, you actually feel poorer.
(13:10) Dude, it reminds me of um Oh, this is one YouTube channel with Don Mazetti from Bro Science. Maybe you know him cuz you're big into lifting, but uh he has this thing where he says that the day that you start lifting is the day that you become forever small. Now I feel like 100% dude that applies I know that. Yeah, that applies to I used to watch that guy. Yeah.
(13:31) Yeah. That applies so well to the 10k a month cuz it's like the day you make 10k a month is the day you'll be forever poor. You'll be forever poor. Yeah. And if you make like 9K the next month, you'll actually like Oh, don't get me started on that. Worse feeling, jump off a bridge. Okay. Um would you say that as you scaled from that first client of yours to maybe like your 10th client? Would you say that your approach changed fundamentally? First client, second client, third client until the fourth or fifth client. And then I like I started
(14:03) to realize, okay, I need to systemize this. Mhm. from zero to 10K. The same principle that worked at first, like the same tasks that you've done to get the first clients, just keep doing them. Just keep doing them. Don't try to change everything. You know, there's also like a mental model. You want to squeeze as much juice from the thing that's working before you move to another thing, you know? Very true.
(14:24) Yeah. So, I think from zero to 10K, I just focus on the same thing, right? Until I hit like a bottleneck, which is was me, you know, fulfillment, right? Then I started like like doing other things like hiring contractors, you know, hiring VAS to handle some of the supplies, right? But when I first got started, I wanted to be a oneman agency, right? I just love that flex.
(14:46) Like I just love it, man. When you say, "Hey, I make 20K and I'm a oneman agency. I don't have to hire anybody." Yeah. So yeah, when when I first got started, definitely like it was basically volume at that point, you know? It's kind of like when you do Upwork. If you send five proposals and you get one client, now we send 10 proposals, now we get two.
(15:08) It's basically math at that point, right? Yeah, pretty much. Might agree with you. I feel like cold emails are similar to that as well. It's just the thing that you are doing, your output is not necessarily directly related to your time. You know, like you put in a thousand cold emails, you're going to 10x the results from 100.
(15:25) The only difference is whereas Upwork literally requires a unit of your time every time you create a proposal and send it out, cold email is one of those like sunk cost things where you might spend 5 10 or 15 hours initially just getting everything up and running. So you you invest in that time, energy, and infrastructure right first, but then it doesn't really scale as much per unit time.
(15:45) It obviously does with replies and stuff, but the slope of that line is a lot lower. So I I feel you. Makes sense. Once you have the infrastructure already up and running, like it only takes like a few hours a week to just manage the entire thing, right? It's not a lot of work when you think about it. You know, one issue that I see people whenever they start a cold email campaign is that delay gratification. That's huge, man.
(16:05) There's this thing that's called outreach lag, right? Which is essentially like there's a time frame when people receive the email and they have to open it. And some people are not really like good with their time. So they might see the email, they they would say, "Okay, I'm going to reply later on.
(16:20) " Right? So like you need to wait a little bit, you know? And some people like freak out and then they go change their copy, etc. Well, now you don't know what copy worked, right? You don't know essentially like what like you can't really track anything, you know? So people like would would start a campaign, they frantically the next day would just go ahead and change everything. 100%. Yeah.
(16:41) Yeah. Uh you're bang on. as you scaled, you know, what were you actually spending your time on daytoday? Like if you could break down what, like a 10-hour work a day or something like that? Like what was hour one going towards hour two and so on and so forth? I start with like a couple tasks that are not so hard, not mentally taxing, and I slowly build my way up just because I've noticed when I like I wake up and the first thing I do is like the hardest thing, it's really not sustainable, you know? So, I start with like some tasks that are they're not
(17:10) that hard, you know, and then I would just slowly build myself into it, right? And I just go into this flow state. Yeah, dude. It's really funny you're mentioning that cuz I've seen this same pattern in a few of the higher earners that I talk to, but they don't actually start their day and focus on the most important thing first.
(17:26) What they do is they have like a bridge of like 15 minutes whereas they wipe the cross from their eyes. They focus on just like something simple, some admin stuff where they'll do like a little bit of journaling or something. The point is just to like it's almost like a pipe that's been backed up. You know, you're just flooding the pipe a little bit and then you get the the juices running.
(17:41) 15 minutes later, now you're in flow. You can actually start doing the stuff that matters, which in your case, I imagine is cold email campaigns and then now creating content. Yes. Yes. So, uh the first thing I do is like a cold email campaigns. After that, some sort of client calls, right? Mhm. And I would batch my clients like in like a couple hours.
(17:59) It's usually like 2 hours, sometimes from like 10:00 a.m. to like 3:00 p.m. or something, you know. After that, it would be just meetings with a couple of the staff, you know, cuz uh right now it's like quite different just because like I have 25 sales reps. Yeah, it's it's interesting, right? Evenings would be just like strategy systems, etc. Makes sense.
(18:21) You hire most of those sales reps locally or what's the strategy been so far? I hire them off Upwork and also Indeed. Yeah. Cool. Cool. Are they on are they like Morocco time or are they like I don't know based around the world. What was your strategy? Like I have a couple ones in US, UK, right? And also like uh Australia.
(18:43) So I've diversified like the sales rep. That's great. Sounds like most of them are Commonwealth countries or they speak English, you know, like natively, which is a good skill to have. When you say sales reps though, like I think there are a couple different types of sales reps. You could have like a like a setter, you could have like a closer, you know, you could probably some VAS, some some inbox managers.
(19:03) Uh what are they doing for you right now? They actually get on the call with prospects, right? Gotcha. Okay, cool. So you're talking like closers. I imagine most of the setting is done from your inbox managers. Yeah, closers actually. Yeah, they only get paid off commission, right? just because I want to incentives just because if I put like a base salary what I've noticed is that do sales reps get comfortable you know they really do get comfortable one thing that that I've learned is aligning incentives right and how people respond to reward and
(19:34) punishment you know yes very very true okay that last word thereof that has some negative connotations you locking these sales people in a cage sod Are they okay? Blink twice if you need help. Sounds salespeople. I mean, they're they're there. They're they're doing fine. I feed them and give them water. Only in only in weekends.
(20:05) Yeah, that's sweet, man. Well, damn, dude. It's not easy to have a business with 20 people in it. Yeah, I know. Yeah. The bigger the business and the more people within it, the more time is spent like cross talk and the less time actually spent like focusing on on client needs. Yeah. Well, I mean, keep in mind like I I didn't hire any sales rep and sales reps until I got into that 40k when I noticed that like I just can't do it.
(20:29) You know, at that point I was the bottleneck and it sucked to let go of the title of a oneman agency which I really liked. But it's fine, you know. It's fine. no longer one man. Trust me, like hiring was definitely like a limiting belief of me, you know, because I I was like, "Okay, these people I'm going to like I'm bringing them to my company and they they will mess up, right?" But then like I just understood that it's just a part of the process, you know, you just have to do it. Very true. I mean, yeah.
(20:57) I mean, it's just one of those things where it's like if you want to make it to the finish line of the race, you got to run the race, right? There's some obstacle between you and making the money you want. You do have to walk through it. I I feel you. So, I mean, Mr. Assad Bel now has uh 20some staff members. He's making over 100K a month.
(21:12) Let's talk about actual skills development. Yeah. Like at the beginning of your journey, you were making a transition from probably learned a little bit of programming and then you're like, "All right, let's see if there are better ways to do this." So, you started no code. From there, how has your skill development been? Both in terms of like the no code and the automation, but then also in terms of just like the rest of your skills like leadership and client management, stuff like that. Like like like run me through
(21:31) it. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I think in order for you to be successful in automation, I think you don't need to be just a builder because I notice like a lot of people like they build cool But when it comes to selling, I think that's one of the most important things, you know, knowing how to actually demonstrate this in a sales call, right? So, I think in terms of skills, I really had to put in the reps in terms of having better sales calls in general, you know, and actually closing.
(21:56) Like when it comes to automation, like I said, you need to like be able to explain the value of the system. So prospects can understand the outcomes that they're going to get if they work with you, right? Mhm. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's kind of difficult to see the value of bunch of cloud services strung together unless you're a good salesperson. I would agree.
(22:14) You got any moments throughout your journey where you wanted to quit. Just stuff was not going your way, too hard, too difficult. Yeah. There was this era where I used to hop on sales calls. I would call it an era, right? I was just not close. I was like, "Okay, this is not working. I don't like sales calls.
(22:29) People are not going to buy from me. they're not going to trust that I'm that I'm going to get them results, etc. Right? Like I just remind myself that the only reason people are not successful is just they stop at this moment. Right? There's nobody in this entire planet that's better than you is just they've been doing this for a while. That's it.
(22:45) Right? So you can learn anything and be the best at everything if you just put in the reps. I always remind myself I just need to pull my pants off. Yeah, that's it. Business is tough. We just need to understand this, right? But this is why we are in business, right? Because it's, you know, you get that dopamine when you are really stressed and you don't know what's if it's going to work or not, but you just go in anyway, right? 100%.
(23:09) You need to shift that paradigm of failure because failure does not exist. Yeah. It's a temporary state of being. It is not a label or identity. Yeah. I think that core nugget of confidence is probably a big chunk of the reason why you were able to prevail. I think that's something that a lot of people are struggling with. 100%. Yeah.
(23:25) Yeah. And this is like for everyone that's watching this, just go down the street. There's money everywhere, right? So when you think about it that way, you need to understand that these people are not better than you. You have to go into that paradigm, that way of thinking. They really deserve that.
(23:40) You actually deserve it. And you just have to be willing to put in the work. A lot of depth there. What you're saying is if you just look around and you look at all the super fancy cars and the roads and the buildings, obviously people were able to produce enormous amounts of wealth. That inherently shatters the limiting belief that you can't do.
(23:56) Yeah, that's great, dude. I like that. If you had to start over from scratch tomorrow with what you know now, how quickly would you join maker school? Just kidding. How would you approach the whole thing differently? I would never join. I'm kidding. Sorry, I just had fun with this. I'm kidding.
(24:17) Uh, so first thing I would do is I would be willing to work on performance first, right? Because let's say because I'm going to just kind of put myself at someone who doesn't doesn't have any case studies, any of that, right? So, the first thing I would do is I would not worry about trying to perfect my campaign at first.
(24:33) I would just get up and running as quickly as possible, right? I would essentially just get pre-warmmed up emails, pick a B2B niche, scrape 5,000 leads, and then I would just use like very very cheap personalization. Let's say I don't want to like like spend that much money. I would just get like very very cheap personalization and then I would just have like a copy with a risk reversal.
(24:50) I would work on performance. I would still pitch an upfront fee. I just want to get up and running as quickly as possible. I wouldn't even wait the warm-up period. I would just get up and run as quickly as possible. I would get premed up, pick a bit of a niche. Yeah, that's it. Because it's action, you know? Yeah, for sure.
(25:06) For sure. And I mean, like once you're on the other side of that action, then you can worry about learning how to make it perfect. Yeah. The cool part is now we have the internet, we have AI and automation. And you can essentially just get access to anybody on the entire planet, right? And like think about how cool it is.
(25:21) Like when you like when you really think about it, you literally pick someone off a list, you get them on a call and you pitch them and you sell them and they pay you money. That's Think about how cool that is, right? Oh, incredible, man. That's the coolest thing on Oh, it's it's nuts to think about. But you know what's funny about what you just said? You're like, "Well, now we have the internet, right, Sod? Like there was ever a time in your life that the internet wasn't a thing.
(25:45) Well, back then you need to you you need to like cold call people, which I think cold calling is silly. Uh I'm not going to lie. Oh yeah, I'd agree. This is going to do all over the first three years of my career. Oh wow. Yeah, I remember you were um door knockocking, right? I was, man. I was doornocking and then we transitioned to doing cold calling.
(26:02) We got Do you know what an auto dialer is? No. It's like a illegal in a lot of places mechanism where you I'm going to keep all the VoIP terminology out of here, but you basically get like a phone number and then you call five people at the same time cuz so so few people actually pick up. So then when some dude picks up, then you transfer the call and then talk to him and then when he hangs up and then another girl picks up, it Yeah, it's spammy as hell.
(26:26) Then like it like routes the call and then you talk to them. So legitimately in like an hour you are talking for 59 minutes and 30 seconds of that hour. It's crazy. So we actually set up an autod dollar dialer for a while. We were doing lots of calls man. I don't remember what the maximum number of calls I ever did in a day was.
(26:41) It was probably over a hundred realistically. Probably like several hundred. So yeah man that was spammy as hell. And lord I'm glad that we're not Did you have like a nickname such as hacker? Nick the hacker. I was the Russian hacker for a while. Uh no I was Nick. That was me. Hello, how's it going? My name's Nick.
(26:59) I had I had a whole pitch and a whole script and everything. Let me just say cold email and these asynchronous methods of outreach way better. So, I think you came up at like the perfect time. Cold email really well. You had access to all the tools. Yeah. Like uh I mean cold email is always like I've heard this idea of like cold emails dying for like the past like like everyone says that and like every year it just gets better, you know? I know.
(27:24) I know. I think the same here's here's the thing. The reason why people are saying that because they're using the exact same tactics, okay? Exact same copy, exact same tactics, and not making any changes to reflect the fact that the industry is changing. People's bar for has gone up or down. You know, at the beginning of the call, you were talking about how like, oh, like I had such a bad limiting belief around ads cuz they like I'll promise all this stuff and it's all BS, right? Like some people, specifically the people that have contact details
(27:48) that are really easy to scrape, do feel the same way about emails that they get. So, it's not necessarily that like cold email is is dying or whatever. It's that the specific tactic that those people were using last year sending via cold email has died, but as long as you're like a reasonable person and you update your compass to reflect like the actual market, you're good, man.
(28:09) I launched a campaign the other day and I did it live on YouTube in like an hour and a half and then I got like eight or nine positive replies. Took me like 13 hours or something in total. like it's not dead by any means, but you will have fluctuations in the effectiveness of a specific approach. And that's why I think the main thing to focus on is not necessarily the tactical implementation, but it's like the deeper strategy.
(28:29) Like what do people actually want? Well, they want stuff that aligns incentives, like Sod was talking about a moment ago. What do people want? They want a risk reversal. They want some way to feel like, you know, not only does it align their interest, but it also aligns their reason. You basically get all those things at once.
(28:44) So, you got you understand that. You're good, man. What I find really interesting about your approach is just how much of it was based off of revenue share. Like that's that's wild to me because of the proportion of people that I've seen start that like Okay. Usually the way it works, have you seen the Midwit graph? Yeah.
(29:01) It's like um it's that like bell curve graph with the guy on the left who's supposedly really low IQ or something and he's like looking really dumb and he's wearing glasses. Then there's a guy on the right with the hood and I'll get I'll get somebody to put it up. Then there's like the normie in the middle, you know, like the middle of the IQ curve.
(29:14) So it's this big meme that's going on. So what's interesting is the people on the left are forced to do performance basis because they're not good enough to actually sell a fixed fee and justify and and build enough value that a customer would feel comfortable giving them money. The people in the middle I'll go fixed fee cuz you know it's like well I get paid a consistent amount every single month for the work that I do.
(29:34) But the people on the far right hand side of the graph aka people like you who've now developed a tremendous amount of skill selling cold email for recruitment or whatever they actually go back to performance-based. Isn't that interesting? they go back to performance because it makes you way more money. Yeah. Yeah.
(29:50) And I think like if it's going to take you just one campaign to work purely off performance and then now you can compile a case study now we can use it. You know, it's not the end of the world, right? Yeah, that's a good point. It's not the end of the world. Realistically, we can get all this stuff up and running in just a few hours.
(30:02) You might as well say yes to that and then move forward with your life. Now you've gotten a client. One thing also that I want to um mention is right now people have actually the blueprint to go from zero to 10, right? Not one, not two, zero to 10, right? If you guys are watching Nick or watching my channel, you have basically the blueprint, the step by step.
(30:24) People back then, right? They would have to basically get their hand dirty in order for them to acquire that knowledge. Right now people have the exact blueprint, right? Hand it to them. We also receive emails be like, "I implemented your strategies and I'm like at 50k MR." I'm like, "Wow, damn." Like, "What? Can I get some profit share? That's what some people are doing." But yeah, it's true. It's true.
(30:46) Um I like the whole idea of a hands dirty thing that you mentioned cuz um when I was uh starting my my door to door stuff, there definitely was no blueprint for that. And uh I spent 99% of my time and energy like on wasted avenues that didn't lead anywhere. Nowadays, it's like, yeah, sure, niches may be a little bit more saturated today than they were back then, but you don't waste 99% of your time going down dead ends that don't actually lead to anything.
(31:08) Like, you actually do have the path in front of you. So, there's something really valuable about that. Not to pitch my own stuff, um although obviously that's part of the implicit purpose of this video. How valuable would you say make moneywithmake.com was to you initially seeing that roadmap? Like, did you get a lot of value out of the free YouTube stuff? Um, if so, how did the value compare to the closed community? How did that change what you were doing? I think this is going to sound a bit emotional, but I feel like make money with make. It's kind of like
(31:33) a family for some reason. Like being with other people that were doing similar things to you, not just lonely road. Yeah. Pull yourself with other people that want to do the same thing. They're willing to put in the work, you know? I think that was like the like the main thing that I really liked about it. Yeah. Okay.
(31:48) And I think people join communities because we all here for the same reason. Yes. That alignment of incentives as you mentioned earlier. Yeah. Awesome. Just before we wrap up, any final advice you want to give to somebody that might be on the fence of starting AI and automation, diving in with both feet. Focus on systems that have real life outcomes.
(32:10) Makes sense as opposed to a lot of the flashy stuff we're seeing. Yeah. Instead of looking at a system, just looking at the features, look at it in another view. Will this get my clients more customers? Will this make me more money? Always look at systems in a more like real life practical business point of view rather than just theory. Makes sense. Yeah.
(32:26) Focus on those simple things that don't scale even for your customers, eh? Yeah. Yeah. The lovely Sad Belaided, thank you very much for coming on, my man. I appreciate you sharing your journey, your story, your mindset, your beliefs. You are a hell of a young man, and I think you're headed in uh God, better direction than than I was at your age.
(32:44) That's for sure. I'm looking forward to seeing how next year is going to go for you. I really am. I think you're going to continue crushing it. So, thank you again. Yeah. Maybe we can do this like six months from now. Yeah. But when you have like an extra zero at the end of your MR, right? Two zeros, man. Awesome, man. Thank you very much, bro.
(33:00) I'm looking forward to uh Yeah. Looking forward to chatting with you again. Rock on. Yeah, man. Yeah. Just

Transcript:
(00:00) The more comfortable you are with failure, the more risks you're going to end up taking and the better your reward's going to get. I can't tell you the number of times people have been like, I just closed this amazing deal. And we're all so stoked for them. We're like, this is awesome. And it's like, all right, so how much money was it? We're still figuring that out. You didn't close them.
(00:20) You got a text message from them. That's what you did. Focusing on the solution first is the wrong approach. focusing on the problem and then interacting with the market as fast as you can to then define better solutions that are very specific to what people are willing to pay for and would generate them more revenue.
(00:36) That's the way to go. AI is seeing less and less as this silver bullet for all of the problems. Like people are realizing no like when you have one AI agent that tries to solve this big thing, things start to fall apart. I was just having a conversation with somebody else about the long-term evolution of AI and automation businesses.
(00:55) I came to the concept that AI automation businesses don't remain AI automation businesses for long. What ends up happening is here's how one of my community members who joined Maker School just 2 months ago is now making $13,000 a month with AI and automation. So my first experience was actually joining a big tech startup.
(01:13) I joined the company is called Flexport and they were creating software the first to really create software for supply chain and the mission that they were on was so ginormous. I was so excited to join. And I was a marketing operations intern at the time and I realized that one of the things that are important for me is the autonomy and a flexibility of going after big challenges and when you join like a company that is a little bit more established the amount of influence you have isn't as substantial.
(01:44) So I guess this was a little bit of an ego issue you know where it's like oh this is my first big internship but I want to change this company and I want to help them you know become bigger and greater. But I've learned a lot from being there and working with people making Flexport big.
(02:02) Flexport's former CMO helped me set up like promote a nonprofit that I was running for Ukraine in 2022. So great connections. From there, I moved to South Korea, which is one of the reasons I couldn't really stay working with Flexport because they had a lot of like regulations around who and where you can work with them from. in Korea got to work with like venture capital firm which was its own world very different to like the way that traditional VCs run in Silicon Valley but that time made me fall in love with startups even more so got to like interact with some Korean
(02:32) startups got back from Korea moved to India then in India I worked with like female entrepreneurs so it wasn't really like startups or SAS but those women in like rural slab communities of India were building real businesses that were changing like the lives of their families, their communities, employing people.
(02:55) So having a chance to kind of support them was pretty huge, too. And then finally moved back to San Francisco for a bit and worked on building my first ever startup, a bunch of my friends and I building plant care AI. The very first startup idea that I had in 2018, it was AI for regulatory compliance.
(03:14) very random just because the companies were IPOs. Very opportunistic idea. Then AI for plant care. I have no idea why we chose that. Neither of us could keep plants alive. Like all of my plants that you see, they probably are going to be gone in the next, you know, week or two cuz I I was going to say they look pretty nice.
(03:31) You clearly know something. It's not going to stay alive for very long. None of us were that excited by the idea, but even more, we were young and impressionable and we really wanted to get startups right. And what that means is we ended up searching how to build a startup and trying to get every single thing right.
(03:48) Be like, "Oh, but how do we create customer personas and should we do this thing in MVP?" And just spend so much time strategizing over building. And while we were building, we were fortunate we got into this really cool Japanese accelerator that was backed by SoftBank. So by the time of the accelerator, we got to pitch to SoftBank executives.
(04:06) But because we were so stuck up in our head on getting this startup right, we didn't spend as much time building out the demo. Didn't have cool things to present at the end. The demo went okay, but it was a huge learning experience to like be always biased towards action. But in a way, it was a failure that carried some valuable lessons. Sounds like it.
(04:26) And you know, in practice, most do. But I like your point on building as opposed to just you know strategizing because at the end of the day unless you are consistently interfacing with the market and I think this is probably even trueer in like Silicon Valley for instance where so many of these ideas are big and grand and you know supposedly worldch changing like unless you consistently interact with the sort of people that you want to sell to you tend to lose kind of track of the whole point 100%.
(04:49) This is something I've learned from you. A lot of the times the solution that people come up with our idea for like plant care AI could be helpful could be not. We could have learned a very specific pain points from interacting with people which we did but not enough but if we had more conversations we could have come up with something that was an AI but was solving a much bigger problem and it would have made that much difference for us in terms of what we were building.
(05:14) The thing that I've kind of heard from you and also in the community is sometimes focusing on the solution first is the wrong approach. So kind of focusing on the problem and then interacting with the market as fast as you can to then define better solutions that are very specific to what people are willing to pay for and what people think would generate them more revenue.
(05:34) That's the way to go. Yeah, for sure. Man, that makes me so happy. I also like the fact that you're like, "Hey, we might have not actually even ended up using AI." Like I think AI is obviously the fancy thing that you want to slap on your startup for VC funding and whatnot, but like you don't actually need AI for a lot of customer problems. Yeah.
(05:49) And I mean right now even in Silicon Valley like one of the reasons I really like being here is people are incredibly smart. There are people who will kind of fall in for AI But like investors are catching up. People are not dumb here. So right now I run socially produced which is like a video marketing agency for tech startups.
(06:08) sweet of video marketing and content automations. And one of the reasons I love having tech founders and startups as ICP is because they are smart. They are going to sniff out and you have to constantly kind of improve and make sure that your solution makes sense and is most effective in order to you know secure the business and grow.
(06:25) And I think people are catching up on that. a lot of like AI is just this slapped on of like oh yeah sure we use like AI in this like minor part of our workflow but also that now AI is seeing less and less as this silver bullet for all of the problems like people are realizing no like when you have one AI agent that tries to solve this big thing start to fall apart technologically like you maybe need more deterministic workflows and more traditional SAS with like AI embedded in critical points and so it's not as smart to come in and say hey we
(06:56) just need this like one big AI agent is going to fix everything. So I think people are catching up especially in Silicon Valley like the knowledge transfer is happening very fast. So for sure for sure because I'm sure there have been some investments in the past that haven't really you know amounted to the promises that were made.
(07:10) That's really cool. Okay. So tell me more about socially produced then and how content and automation weave together in your successes over the last couple of months. Yeah. So I started socially produced initially just as a content agency. Now it grown into being a video marketing service for tech startups. When I was starting, it was actually in summer of last year that I first had the idea.
(07:35) And initially I just thought I'll be creating videos. I didn't really know in which capacity it would be monetized or if I wanted to build a business. I was joking that in a way from like the fall of last year until maybe January I was running it as a boutique like video production thing like almost like a hobby.
(07:55) I was just like I like doing this. I like coming to this events and you know creating videos and now once I've made the decision to actually build a business around it it's much more strategic and focused on both like video production and some content automation for startups. Makes sense. Yeah, I like your point on boutique.
(08:11) You know, I was just talking to Assad last week. I'm not sure if you had a chance to look at that case study, but it was like, you know, if you don't have customers for your business, it is essentially a hobby. The proportion of your business that is a hobby decreases proportionally with the number of customers you acquire.
(08:24) So, it sounds like over the course of the last year, your business has become less hobby and less hobby and more business and more business, right? Were there any like major changing points for you aside from joining our lovely community? Of course. Yeah. In the fall of last year, I've made the decision to run it as a business. Mhm.
(08:40) And the changing point came from me feeling ready to end this sbatical of two years that I've taken on. So I was working in startups non-stop since 2018 and then in 2024 when the war in Ukraine hit which is my home country that's created a huge dissonance about the world and my place in it and how I'm spending my time on earth. So I took kind of a break.
(09:02) I was working on a few projects here and there, but I was working in stuff like legal philosophy and poetry and whatnot and trying to figure out what I want to spend my time on. And so, it's very validating that eventually I lended back where I came from, you know, with tech and startups.
(09:18) And now that I've kind of focused on video and realized that that's something that both the market needs and I'm interested in working on, that's when I kind of made the conclusion that okay, I'm ready to get back into this in a more serious capacity and ready to build a business around it. And in November when I decided now, we're doing it seriously, I put together a landing page and pitched and got my first very big client.
(09:41) So that was kind of the first pivotal point. And then this year it's focusing more on scaling and actually focusing on retainer business rather than just oneoff projects. That's where I feel like I'm taking it on to the next step. Gotcha. Makes perfect sense. Yeah. You validated what works, right? You've got that.
(09:59) I mean, it's the micro version of the product market fit and now you're just scaling it up. Makes perfect sense to me. Yeah. Can I ask um how much money did you make last month with this business? Yeah. So last month's we are at like 13,000. Quite far from the final goal that I want for a monthly retainer and I started to only count like retainer clients instead of oneoff like project income.
(10:22) We're we're on a good trajectory, I'd say. Yeah, that's fantastic. So uh tell me a little bit more about that. You're only counting retainer clients because those add to your quotequote MR, right? But um you also have some one-off clients as well. How did you structure like one-off client offerings versus retainer? Like what would you say are the differences here? The one-off clients were kind of my intro into the business world.
(10:39) That's when I was taking it from a hobby to a business and focusing on generating my first revenue. The goal and the structure for the one-off video production services was when there was a big tech event happening in Silicon Valley, which there are quite a bunch of, um, I would reach out and pitch and get to come to the event and create video at the event, which then would be like packaged to them in x number of videos.
(11:06) So yeah, it wasn't like content automations just yet. We are not essentially like a content automation agency. the emphasis is on video marketing and growth whereas the content automation is very much used internally and other kinds of automations as well like I've learned a lot from you on on boarding and other like client satisfaction automations that we're using internally to create a really good customer experience because the thing is with our ICP which is tech founders tech startups a lot of the times it doesn't make sense to sell content automations
(11:39) because A, there's not going to be anyone who's going to be running it for them because their capacity is so small. There's like a small team focused on building very technical projects and B, they can probably build it out themselves and like make the software if they really really want to. Yeah, I mean they're giant nerds. I understand.
(11:56) Uh, no. Jokes aside, it's interesting you touch on that point cuz I was just having a conversation with somebody else about like the long-term evolution of AI and automation businesses. And I came to the concept that AI automation businesses don't remain AI automation businesses for long. What ends up happening is you obviously test a variety of different automations.
(12:14) You build them for your own business. But then you find that when you sell the output of one specific automation to one specific customer, it delivers a disproportionate reward. So last week when I had sod on for instance, he started off as an AI and automation agency for the most part. He was selling a variety of different AI automation services.
(12:30) But his company essentially functioned as a software consultancy. It's like new project coming in. We're going to scope it. We're going to figure out how we can deliver the most value and then we're going to go line item by line item give you some deliverables and there we go. As he grew he shifted so that it wasn't like an all you can eat buffet at the AI automation agency restaurant.
(12:47) It was like oh actually I find when I sell to recruitment agencies I make way more money. Hm. Interesting. Now, what sorts of systems do I sell to recruitment agencies that make me more money? Well, it tends to be some sort of cold email system. Okay. And then you shift from being this AI automation big consultancy, which I think is a great place for people to start because you just learn so much and obviously you get very skilled at the technology into like a cold email agency specifically targeted towards, you know, recruitment businesses for instance. So, I think
(13:10) this is, you know, your journey is pretty interesting because I don't want to say it's in the other direction, but you're testing out various angles and various like retainer products and various recurring services with with your clients, I'm sure. And when you find that product or the service that delivers you like a disproportionate return, that's when you slap a bunch of systems on it and then you start selling the outcomes of the automations, not necessarily the automations themselves.
(13:32) Does that make sense? Exactly. That's something that I can also charge premium for because the issue in a place where I am and with my SAP is not money. Like if I can show that something will deliver results or has like a potential to deliver the results then they are willing to pay whatever it takes to get this result if it makes sense for them right so it's not so much about saving on like oh my gosh like yes just give us the the content automation we'll try to scrape our resources together like the time is a resource that they don't have
(14:05) and they just want the result most of the time so it made more sense to sell like the outcome and sell kind of a white glow service. And right now I'm exploring like potential directions for building a software. So like one of the hypothesis I have is once I can figure out ways to automate like video content production and figure out like the attribution and stuff that would really make us run this smoother and more effective at volume and high quality internally that we could package that as a software product and sell and very
(14:41) likely that other startups would benefit from like a more comprehensive solution. But then kind of similar to what you're sharing is the emphasis is again on figuring out not just like how do we automate everything within like video content production but what are the most revenue generating points within this video journey in video marketing that we can then more clearly attribute to revenue and get more people interested in buying the software.
(15:07) I think I reached out to you initially because you posted a win and you closed some $10,000 a month client or something. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, what was the like initial lead generation strategy to get that client interested? Like were you doing things like cold DMs, cold outreach? Were you like doing like warm network reactivation? What I'm really interested in for you is like what's like a repeatable scalable way to grow the thing that you've obviously demonstrated you can go from zero to one with which is you know this retainer
(15:32) thing and then sell like 50 of them or something if that's something that you want to do. I wish I could say that I ran, you know, like 100 cold emails a day. That was just one of the hundred. That is not what happened. I've been lucky to reach for leads and opportunities that I'm able to close. And for this specific client, it was a warm inbound LinkedIn connect and then I just sent like a very casual check-in.
(15:58) So there's no kind of grand story about this. And then for my very first client which I lended the biggest venture capital firm in America as my client through cold outreach. And so in that case, this case as well, it was having an appropriate cold outreach or like warm outreach in in this last case and then having the some preparation or some work to show for so when they go in and like see what I'm offering, there's some kind of results or some videos to back up what I'm offering to them. 100%.
(16:30) Yeah, this is that value based outreach, right? I mean nowadays the bar is so high with this stuff because the average person gets spammed so many freaking times that if you don't back it up with something it's like okay I mean how many emails have you gotten in the last 24 hours being like hey Anna I just recorded this Loom video can I send it over send me those people on Twitter they give me such an I have still kind of a nice tendency to me where I just like sometimes I want to respond and say like hey like this is bad like don't do
(16:57) this or like that I make a conscious step back and a decision of like they will learn that when people don't respond, that means the cold outreach was bad. And so I'm like, I will not engage with it in any way. This will be the lesson. And I think I also take that for myself. You know, when people don't respond to my cold outreach, I know that they probably seen it.
(17:15) Even if they're very high-profile, there's still a very likely chance that they've seen it. It was just bad and not worth their time to respond. And so the learning, you know, gets transferred to the next time I do a cold outreach. What sort of like did you put together an asset for this client of yours that you uh sourced through cold? Um, this was the initial one I guess back in I don't know if there's Yes, for that one I had like a huge proposal.
(17:36) So it was A6 andZ which is like a pretty big VC here in America and they were organizing like San Francisco Tech Week and I've done like videos previously with another big accelerator called Tech Stars. So I've shared like some of the examples from that like more pro bono fun project that I did that were like very relevant to their event.
(17:57) I wrote out like a very detailed proposal and I slapped it like two days before the event started. So, it was very timely. Had a great sales call, I guess, and they brought me on. Fascinating. I like that you timed it so that it was like 48 hours before. And I'm sure you made it very easy to say yes to.
(18:14) It was just like, "Hey, say yes. I'll be there with my camera, with my equipment. We'll do all the editing and we'll publish it in all these platforms." That wasn't intentional. Actually, that week like prior to the event, I think it was on Wednesday when I decided that I'm either taking this business seriously and I'm like building a business or I'm going to go get a job because I I was like there's no way around.
(18:35) I want to get finally back to like a normal level of income. This whole like period of me reading philosophy and doing podcasts about like AI governance is behind me. Like I want to get back to making money. I think it was like Wednesday. day, I was like, "Okay, well, we got to have some kind of landing page.
(18:52) " By Thursday night, I had the landing page done. By Friday, I was like, "Well, what's the next step? Like, where are we getting clients?" And then I found SF Techch Week. I was going to actually email every single person who's like sponsored this event. Like, I use AI to find their emails.
(19:07) And so, I started reaching out to them. And then on Saturday morning, I was like, why don't I just reach out to to A6 and Z themselves and just pitch them. So, and we've closed it over the weekend. And on Monday, I was ready to go. So, it wasn't that intentional, but No, I think that's brilliant because you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
(19:22) That's number one. Uh, number two, you could totally build like a scalable outbound strategy with that stuff. Anna, think about this. You're talking about scraping like events in San Francisco that are related to technology, right? Oh, there's so many sources where you could get that.
(19:37) Then what? You just need to identify the sponsors. That that it's easy. You could totally crush this. I'm just like imagining a campaign where you are first in everybody's email inbox 48 hours before some event with some super crazy offer like hey you know we shot for A16Z a couple of months ago and like here's that here's this here's that here's what we're going to give you for free. Yeah, that's that's 100%.
(19:57) One of the problems is like with A6 andZ, they have much bigger budgets. So that's something that they can afford in a way, but for a lot of the events, there is like a very streamlined budget and they usually go over it anyways. So coming in hot like a few days before the event might not be the best strategy, but there's definitely a way to like time it right to get a lot of them closed.
(20:18) The issue is I no longer want to focus on events because it is kind of a oneoff engagement. I'm shifting focus to getting clients that we can like have on a retainer for many months and years to come. Are you using any of these same things for your own business? Like obviously the best way for an SEO business to market is when the customers find them via SEO.
(20:41) And the best way for a video marketing business is for people to find them via video. Yeah. So I've been doing content myself mainly on LinkedIn. We've plateaued at some point because I've been writing this on my own for a while. I've realized that the way for me to service the clients is the best is to step back from content.
(20:58) But now that we have aesthetic cash flow, I can afford editors. So, it's going to be much easier for me to like start reinvesting back into like my content and my personal brand. And you're totally right. You know that this thing works when my founder brand works as well. So, that's definitely going to be the emphasis.
(21:17) And I'm slowly like getting back into Twitter, which is like a scary place to be. I've like I used to be on Twitter I think in 2021. Twitter growth, I think, is essentially different from growing on all of the platforms like LinkedIn with video or like YouTube, but it's worth it because that's where our ICP hangs out. So, makes sense.
(21:36) I'm sure I'm going to be seeing you and your like your tech Twitter bro DMs all up in my my ex.com pretty soon. Yeah. Yeah. I could make you $50,000 per month. Hey, Nick, fancy a quick automation for your lead gener. Wow, no way. No way. I should have done that myself. Uh, it's funny. I got all these guys now with the school community that I run, right? They're all like, Nick, I can add 15 clients and make you $5,000.
(22:03) And I'm like, whoa, that's crazy. Maybe I should put you up on the offer, big duck. Then there's like some 16-year-old like in a wife beater, you know? That is so funny. and so cute. But yeah, they'll learn their lesson though. That's fine. Like, let let them learn. I used to go uh I used to do door to door and I was like I looked like the you know super babyfaced when I was like 19 20 and I was like that's intense.
(22:26) So I would do that like knock on a door be like hey I'm going to make you all this money. So like I know firsthand how that is and you you kind of do have to go through this initial introductory hazing. Like another thing that I'm starting to talk about more often in maker school is there's like this discord between comfort and then speed, right? Like if you want to do something fast, you necessarily have to sacrifice your comfort in order to do it.
(22:48) You know, going door todoor and having people laugh at you or pitching A16Z and having some intern be like what a loser or whatever. You know, in your specific case, that stuff's necessary for growth. I wouldn't even say it's optional. It's like necessary. Yeah, that's one of the reasons when I started talking about like cold email, I think this should be like the next lead genen strategy that I should focus on because I have a feeling that we are going to grow quickly to a stage where we would not need lead genen like at that level but I think that for character
(23:16) development I should do it. Like I think it's important. Yeah. For my character arc like I need to do cold spells and I need to fail and embarrass. I think I've already have quite a few both like Twitter DMs and other like DMs and I've met quite a few people that I've called DM like years ago in a very embarrassing way that once they followed me back on on Twitter they're like hey like I see you texting me like please just don't read that message like just forget all about that start from the beginning.
(23:43) Okay. Um but I think yeah I think I think it's important. I think the more comfortable you are with failure, the more risks you're going to end up taking and the better your rewards going to get eventually. So cold email is important. Agreed. It's funny because we talked about what would happen if you were 10x the size, but what are your goals with this business? Like are you talking revenue goals? Do you want some sort of impact goal? Just off the top of your head, like where do you where do you want to take socially produced? Yeah,
(24:10) definitely revenue goals is is what we're focusing on. I've come a long way from starting startups focused on some kind of outside mission. I've essentially realized that each time that I would run a startup to like help people save their plants and make planet more green or help startups do this thing the death of an idealist.
(24:32) Ladies and gentlemen, like every single time I'd done that, I think reflecting back on it, it was quite egotistical. It was just like I want to make this big impact on this space and essentially the goal of a business is to generate revenue and my way of you know generating revenue is by helping other startups generate revenue by solving for their distribution with video content.
(24:57) So, one of the parts that I like about business is that there's very clear incentives. Like, once you kind of push away all of the narratives, like we're all building something that solves problems for others that they are willing to pay to have solved. That's kind of how I'm framing it this time around.
(25:13) I also love video, but I think that's just kind of secondary. Mhm. And then in terms of the revenue goals, and maybe I'm thinking small, I think we might get much further than this, but my goal was to get to 50K a month by the end of the year, but from like the current conversations that I have with existing clients and how many other clients they can refer to us, I think we might surpass that goal much faster than December.
(25:38) But well, it's May, so that's another seven months from now. You acquired one client that pays you $10,000 a month. Yeah, we're just close another one. you're about to close another one or you you just did. We did, but another really good tip that you've had like don't claim a client until the money hits your bank.
(25:54) So, we verbally agreed to another client, but the money has not hit the bank just yet. I'm crossing my fingers for you. I'm not sure if this is a local Silicon Valley or San Francisco connection. Those are definitely a lot stronger. But yeah, I'm glad that you brought that up cuz I can't tell you the number of times people have been like, I just closed this amazing deal.
(26:09) And we're all so stoked for them. We're like, this is awesome. And it's like, all right, so how much money was it? And it's like, we're still figuring that out. I'm like, you didn't close them. You got a you got a text message from them. That's what you did. Even like an agreement signing. So, I'm not very big on the agreement side of things just because, you know, I work primarily with small to mid-size businesses and I work internationally.
(26:28) So, in practice, if I'm making like $5,000 per month off a client, client doesn't pay me for a couple months or whatever. My total owings are $10,000. It would cost me way more money to try and go after somebody, you know, than it would if I were to actually just go and acquire new clients for the $10,000.
(26:41) So logically speaking, like the agreements and stuff, to me, it's always just added friction. That said, I think there are a couple points where you can consider a client signed. If you have an agreement signed with them, there's some sort of legal binding and slash or if you have money sent or received, you know, in your pocket.
(26:57) So to anybody that's watching that might think that they have a client, you don't really have that client until those requirements are met. Unfortunately, that's that's the reality. And I've actually waited until sharing the win in the community. I'm not big on like sharing things publicly, but I felt like I owe it partially to you and to the community for my success.
(27:15) And so I wanted to kind of share that alongside of like the lessons that I've learned to see if they can help someone else. But I waited until I've had the money in the bank. We worked for two weeks together. I knew this is going to be like a serious retainer client to then share that this is like actually like, hey, this is a win, I guess.
(27:34) Very good call. I appreciate that. Yeah, obviously seeing wins in communities like Maker School, they help me and they help a lot of other people in the group overcome their limiting beliefs, but there's also this sort of gamification aspect where that's the metric that they go for.
(27:48) In a way, it's like a perverse Instagram. It's not necessarily the good thing to get a bunch of likes on your post, but I guess the way that I conceptualize it is like at least you're getting likes for making money as opposed to something else. And that's a challenge when you're building a personal brand, like a founder brand. For some of the decisions and some of business situations you end up with, you don't really want to have a feeling of public pressure and you don't want to feel like you're in a public eye as much when you're making this decisions. And
(28:17) so I felt like this kind of breakthrough that I've had in the business happened when I was in this quiet point in my life when I was just alone in my room for 2 and 1/2 weeks. I took a break from content. I decided I'm going to take it seriously and I've gotten through so so far within that such a short period of time.
(28:37) And so making it public felt kind of weird like almost unnecessary and felt like I should continue building in quiet which I think I will for some time until I reach like a meaningful milestone. I was talking to another founder too who's big on like vlogging their journey on YouTube and I think it's fantastic but for me personally like I'm worried what percentage of my decisions will become kind of performative and shallow just because I feel the need to kind of like explain myself and make sense to to people on YouTube. So there's that kind of concern
(29:07) and something to think through if you are sharing stuff whether it's like within a community or publicly on social media. Yeah, I definitely know what you mean. How are you dealing with that? Yeah. Yeah, it's a good question. I'll answer that. But I think humans are consensus creatures. And so obviously we make decisions in part based off of the opinions of those around us.
(29:26) And so it's very important for the opinions of the people that you're taking into account to be good opinions. And when you blast out everything that you're doing socially, they don't all tend to be good opinions. can't tell you the number of like extraordinarily limiting beliefs I've seen when I started sharing my own business growth online and just like the weird takes and I really did have to put blinders on that as well and just be like hey like you know I'm not going to make any of these decisions because that person thinks it's a good idea or that
(29:51) person thinks it's a bad idea but because it's me you know so 100% with you there and I think there's a very intelligent mature way of thinking about branding there's another hidden cost I would say and that's that you are just spending a lot of time on something that as you mentioned is performative but also So that just doesn't directly contribute to revenue in the short term.
(30:08) Yeah. Like if you have let's just say 10 hours in the day to keep the math really simple. You spend like an hour a day recording your vlog or touching it up or editing it. That's 10% that you are not utilizing that you could probably be doing lead genen with, right? And sure, maybe it's like technically still a form of lead genen, but the audience that's going to be watching Anna build her personal brand is very different from the audience that Anna might be targeting as like a video marketing agency. So that's something that I wish
(30:33) beginners understood a little bit more because I see a million bajillion, you know, day in the life of an entrepreneur on my journey to 10K month. And I'm like, I get it. I really do. And I I think like the sharing culture is valuable and you're going to look back on this in a few years and probably be really stoked that you had it.
(30:47) But like, who's going to watch your stuff, man? Like unless you have some major accomplishment unless you're like focusing your time on revenue, unless you have the money that allows you to zoom out and not focus 100% of your time on revenue generation, like you should be focusing on the revenue generation. Yeah, content it takes a lot of time, especially when you're not formed as a founder yet and you don't have that experience of putting the blinders on and kind of have a compass and having had the the experience of being in tough
(31:12) situations where you've made the right calls. you know, you are going to get influenced by all this random people. And then I do think that like a lot of the content ends up being performative, which isn't necessarily bad. Like maybe it makes more sense for you to act out, you know, the journey of a founder and you made this like in a cute little TV show and then you got partnerships and and you become a content creator and that's fine as well.
(31:35) But and that's also something I think I've taken from you in a way where I've realized that sometimes and actually in most times probably the faster way to get to revenue is by focusing on direct actual regen where you're reaching out to clients and having something that they're willing to pay money for. But then once you do achieve that milestone, it's just so much easier to come in and say, "Hey, I have a business that makes 15k a month.
(31:58) " Because now all of a sudden you have all these people that are aspiring to this outcome and that would listen to you because you are kind of where they want to be. And from there it just becomes easier and easier to build the audience. And you're kind of right like with your videos as well.
(32:14) When you start a video saying like, "Hey, I'm Nick and I make this much amount of money in a month and I'm aspiring to be to like 2 million." All of a sudden people are like, "Oh, this is the level where someone operates. This is their achievement and credibility. makes sense to listen and see what else this person has to say. Yeah. Uh well said.
(32:32) I think the idea is you just demonstrate some form of exceptionalism. Like what makes Lionel Messi interesting to watch, you know, the soccer player? It's like the fact that he's like the top 0001% in his field, which is some form of football that I will never be able to I can hardly chew gum and walk straight at the same time.
(32:50) But to me, as somebody that like isn't very good at that, like it's just inherently interesting to watch this guy like talk, man. He could be sitting on a subway scrolling through Instagram reels. Have you seen the um Canu Reeves in New York like on the subway and it's just like people that are like, "Oh my god, it's Can's just scrolling through his phone.
(33:04) " It's inherently interesting to see this dude who's like achieved top whatever 1% performance in acting. Just scroll through his phone, right? I think we're just like naturally drawn to some form of exceptionalism. I don't know why. Mirror neurons, some form of empathy, whatever. And like if you want to stand out in content, you have to perform some sort of thing super exceptionally well because it's just a million other people all doing the same And it's like if you don't have that, then why why would somebody listen to you as opposed
(33:28) to somebody else? This is the same reason why when you made your wins post in Maker School blew the hell up, right? It's like oh my god, like she just did something we're all trying to do right now. That's crazy. And then like anytime you say anything now, people are people are listening, right? On a small scale because it's maker school, but the same applies to social media as well. Yeah.
(33:46) I think like I've reflected on that a while back and I think desire is one of the greatest ways to get people like motivated and interested like if you have something that they want whether it's money some social position any other thing that people want display outcomes that people want and they follow because of their desire makes sense to capitalize on that instead of spending all of this energy trying to like trick people into engaging with you by my gosh like coming up with this emotionally exaggerated stories or very
(34:20) creative cuts or or whatnot. Yeah. Like the crazy short form stuff which I'm sure you see all the time in video. I mean I've I made them. So like I've we we all kind of fall into this stuff. And when I first started actually with the idea of just making videos like before socially produced became a business thing.
(34:41) I was thinking of, oh, I can document my journey of building this thing from the ground up. Wouldn't that be cool? And then that plateaued pretty quickly and didn't bring the virality that I thought I would get cuz no one really cared and I think that was very fair of them not to care and I'm glad that I didn't take that route to be honest. Yeah.
(35:05) Yeah. I 100% resonate with you. This has been extraordinarily interesting, chat, Anna, because I feel like the agency space is services which aren't very glamorous. And I'm not going to on where you live, but I think that like in San Francisco, a lot of people that are there are very they're obsessed with that idea of impact that you mentioned, but so much so that like the primary thing for them is not customers.
(35:29) It's probably some form of fundraising or something initially. And hearing somebody that has operated in that environment now building and running a successful agency and just like your different take on all this stuff I guess has has been really interesting. I was down in San Francisco a year and a half ago, something along those lines.
(35:45) There was a young man who was a terribly brilliant young guy who was fundraising for some voice agent call thing and he had seen my content and some of the systems that I had built and he was just like obsessed with this idea of getting me on as like one of his team members and then getting into YC or he had some YC connection or something and he kept on pitching me like day after day being like, "Dude, I need you.
(36:06) I need you. I'm willing to do anything to get you on board. You've actually made money with this and nobody else has. Trust me, it's like a crazy competitive advantage. I'm like, dude, competitive advantage, dude. Silicon Valley, man. You guys are got walking robots and Whimos and I'm making like 15 $20,000 with some AI automation.
(36:23) Why is that a competitive advantage? Well, anyway, I ended up going down there and and seeing and you know, connecting and talking with a few people and like I I learned that that really is that really is a competitive advantage. Like the ability to actually sell a product and not necess like to a customer and not just to an investor.
(36:38) I've mentioned earlier in our conversation that there is that potential direction for us where we create a software product and one of the things that I know are already going to be like a big differentiator for us is that we have money and that's going to put us in a very different position when we're pitching to VCs if we are like I think I'm definitely more leaning towards bootstrapping and that's why kind of getting to higher numbers by the end of this year would be meaningful, but it puts you in a very different
(37:10) place of leverage. It invalidates the market demand, right? Because people are already willing to pay and they're willing to pay premium because you don't have this like perfect product. You have like a clunky product and then you have a service on top of and so people are willing to pay premium to solve this problem.
(37:26) you have like firsthand experience working with your ICP very intimately on getting like in our case to like a video marketing production system that would create results for them and then you also have revenue so you're not coming to them with no money no ability to like hire a team get to an MVP and you probably already have something working because you were able to like invest some of your revenue from the services into building this product and that is so much different to what like traditionally happens when someone comes with like just an idea and maybe
(38:01) like a strong technical talent. Okay, last point before I make you sell my community. For me, it's kind of the idea between like the standout brilliance and then like the slow steady incremental progress and I find personally as somebody that comes from the agency space, I'm just much more attracted to the latter.
(38:16) Just seems a lot more reliable to me. Yeah. Anna, how important would you say that Maker School was to your success? Yeah. So, let me like share my real thoughts. Oh, boy. I don't know. I would say that the biggest like change that it's made for me personally is that it helped me move away from this like boutique hobby kind of running business into making a decision to run an actually profitable business.
(38:44) So, I think that decision like I've had to make on my own, but being exposed to like the way that you run your company and your business through like your daily updates channels and then also seeing other people kind of struggle with the same limiting beliefs and the same questions and the same ways that they trick themselves into believing that they shouldn't be doing cold outreach or believing that, you know, a certain amount is not an option for them.
(39:14) like having exposure to that slapped me in the face a little bit and and made me make a decision. And I think I would have been comfortable like as long as I wasn't like lying to myself, I would have been comfortable just having a hobby business, you know, just kind of being like, "Oh, this is like a chill comfortable life where I make some money.
(39:32) " But I knew that eventually this wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to build a serious business. that I got to see firsthand the actions and behaviors that people execute on a daily basis to get to the outcomes that I wanted to be. And once I saw that and saw how much of a dissonance it was with what I was focusing my time and energy on, I knew that I had to kind of take an action and stop kind of fooling myself.
(39:52) So that was the biggest thing. Another thing, there's also a lot of like tactical benefits. I'd say things that I could have figured out on myself, but would have taken me like so much more time. you had information that I could search in maker school easily. So, let's say I didn't know what software I'm going to go with invoicing recurring clients and it was just so easy to be like, "Oh, do I want a Quickbook or should I pay 3% for Stripe?" That was a question.
(40:16) Type it up. You guys already had a discussion about it. And you're like, "Don't try to be cheap. Like, focus on, you know, providing frictionless experience for the client." So, I sit myself down. I'm like, "Yeah, probably shouldn't be cheap." Even though that was my initial inclination was coming from a place of scarcity, but client experience takes precedence. So, let's not be cheap.
(40:32) Let's pay for Stripe. The same I think was like for Panda do like just recently where I was like oh I should pay for Panda do subscription and almost like for a second I was like oh but I have five emails and I could have a docuign free trial for five months and I'm just like what are you doing? Like I I also like looked up people talking about Pentadoc and someone else had the same concern.
(40:55) They're like, "Should I pay for Panda Dog because it's kind of expensive or should I go as a bunch of other random stuff?" And you or someone else was just like, "No, like pay for the Panda." Like you have to believe in yourself and you have to have like a degree of abundance to run the business. It's not worth like an hour of your life to be sending out the silly proposals and then also it's not worth like having created the friction for the client.
(41:17) So that helped me be like, okay, I'm going to not make this scarcity like dissence. And the way that you know that happened is by just seeing the conversation happen in the maker school. And the last one, the the last but not easy prepared, please. I'm not usually like a big endorser of things, but I think this was a great investment for my money.
(41:35) I got so much value out of this community. So thanks. Thanks for that. Um, but the last one was sales. And that one was so meaningful. both you've had like great sales documents I think for like lining out what you should do when you're like preparing a video pitch for the client so like an initial part of the sales how you should actually act on the sales call and the way that you should frame a sales call and then there's also the sales trainings with Connor that were just incredible and that had a huge difference and I have a funny story not
(42:08) a funny it wasn't funny but I have a story to showcase for it I had a dream tech company that I wanted to work with for a long time. They produced a podcast that I was listening to when I was working like in South Korea on this VC project. I took another short break to go to this cute little island called Jedju and I cycled for hours and I listened to that podcast and it inspired a lot of my kind of entrepreneurial aspirations.
(42:36) It was called Masters of Scale by Reed Huffman. It was very well produced podcast and shared entrepreneurial stories about really big cool tech founders. And one of the goals that I've had when things went well with A6 and Z was to get to work on an event for the Masters of Scale podcast. And I reached out to the team with a creative video outreach which ended up being successful.
(43:00) I didn't get into the event itself, but I started like a conversation chain with them and it dragged all the way into April until like our very last call came. And within that call, which essentially was a sales call, we caught up with the person who was my point of contact there. It was extremely vague. We ended the call like me not having any clear value prop and just coming from the space of this has been my dream like I wish we could you know create content for you and them being like we see your enthusiasm but we have no idea what the difference it
(43:29) would make for our business so it doesn't really make as much sense but they were willing to find some kind of agreement or common ground where we could experiment with their content and essentially the deal didn't go through which makes so much sense and I was left with this realization that in a sales call, which essentially this last call goal was a sales call.
(43:50) It's important to shut up about my own like aspirations and creative visions and just focus on understanding what the client wants and what kind of problem that they're struggling with. How can I position the and even forget about the solutions that I have in my head and just like really listen to what they want the way that they want it.
(44:08) Start generating hypothesis like do you want this type of videos or this type of videos? then ask them immediately. Being very open to hear no and being very open to hear that the solutions I'm offering are not making any sense and having that plan to readjust immediately. That was huge. And this is something that I've learned from the sales goals and like the questions that I've asked and the way that I was able to understand them was partially inspired by a lot of the sales materials that you had in the school.
(44:35) And so within that one week, like I've literally had one week where I knew that I'm going to have this sales call. My last sales call with my dream company went incredibly bad, like complete failure. I left it knowing that it was already really bad. And so I was like, well, we don't have much time here, so we got to like completely change the way that I approach sales.
(44:54) And so a lot of the materials and like the training was incredibly helpful. I really appreciate that. I love that point that you touched on, which is that unfortunately clients don't actually really care that much about how passionate you are and how much you love them and all of this great stuff. They just want to know what you can do for them and your passion and stuff.
(45:17) It's marginal. Sure. Some people will like it, but it's a 1% thing. 99% of it's like, please, how much money can you make me? Exactly. And that's why when you ask me about like the mission versus the revenue generation, I think it's honest to say that we are focused on generating revenue. And it creates so much clarity and I cannot like emphasize enough how much I love clarity.
(45:39) Like it actually created me so much sense of like comfort and much more certainty in knowing that I am delivering on something that is going to generate revenue for this client. the client is going to be happy and I'll be happy working on it because I know that it's it's going to be fulfilling because it's going to be working for the client and also help me retain the client.
(45:59) So, it's going to keep my business going. Like that sense of alignment with revenue is so crucial and it's so also comforting to me and that's why when we're planning the product content automations in in a form of a product in the future I will 100% going to be prioritizing only on the parts where the content kind of directly ties into some kind of like revenue and and revenue attributions because it's going to be so much clarity on like where I'm helping people make money and it's going to be much easier to sell. they're going to be much
(46:29) happier with the product. So, it's a good way to approach business. I think to paraphrase from one of my current coaching clients and good friends, Dylan Watkins, revenue is a clarifying function for business. If you just hold revenue above all else, then everything else that you do in service of revenue makes your life that much easier. 100%.
(46:50) Anna, thank you very much for making it on the call. I really appreciate having you hearing your journey, hearing how Silicon Valley agencies, revenue, and how all of these have intertwined to make you what sounds like a pretty formidable business person. I'm excited to see you 10x. Thanks. I'm excited, too. Thanks, Anna. Talk soon. Bye.


USing this tyr to make something less manual but also not tooo expensive. USe @Web 

GOAL: Book 20 Calls per week for selling Power Solutions 


---

_**Assistant**_



---

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Right, let's get this user flow updated to target **20 calls per week** for your power solutions, making it less manual but still cost-effective, drawing on those examples you shared.

First, I'll rename the existing user flow file from `user_flow_v1.md` to `user_flow_v2.md` to reflect our iteration.


---

```bash
mv Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v1.md Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md
```

```
venvnicholasfeyintolafolarin-coker@Nicholass-MacBook-Pro Gas % 

```

---

Okay, the file is renamed to `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`.

Now, I'll update the content of `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`.

The key changes will be:
*   **Increased Target:** Aiming for 20 booked calls/week.
*   **TAM & Scaling Focus:** Incorporating the idea of needing a larger Total Addressable Market (TAM) to sustain higher volume, inspired by "Vibe 2".
*   **Systematised Outreach:** More emphasis on tools and a repeatable process for lead sourcing and email campaigns, drawing from "Vibe 1" (Apollo.io, Instantly.ai) and "Vibe 3" (cold email focus).
*   **Efficiency in Personalisation:** Exploring ways to make personalisation less manual or at least batch-processed.
*   **Clearer Call to Action:** Ensuring the process drives towards booking a call.
*   **Leveraging AI:** Highlighting where AI can streamline steps, as mentioned in the RevGen Partners article and the Copy.ai article.

Here's the proposed edit:


---

```diff
- # User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v1)
+ # User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v2)
  
  **User:** Nicholas (System Owner/Operator)
  
- **Primary Goal:** Send 10 highly personalised emails to qualified leads for generator sales each week.
+ **Primary Goal:** Book 20 qualified sales calls per week for power solutions (generators, IPPs).
+ 
+ **Core Principles (Inspired by External Insights):**
+ *   **Volume & TAM:** To achieve 20 calls/week, a significant Total Addressable Market (TAM) is crucial. The system must support high-volume outreach. (Ref: Vibe 2)
+ *   **Systematisation:** Rely on defined processes and tools for scalability and efficiency. (Ref: Vibe 1, Vibe 3)

Alright, the `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md` file has been updated with the new flow.

Take a look at this revised user flow. It's geared towards higher volume and more automation, incorporating ideas from the examples you sent, like focusing on TAM, using tools for lead sourcing and email campaigns, and leveraging AI for personalisation and scoring. The aim is to create a more systematic and scalable approach to hit that 20 calls/week target.

What are your initial thoughts on this V2 flow? Are there any parts that jump out as needing more detail, or areas you'd like to adjust? We can continue to refine this.

- most of the time today, leads come from going to social events and talking about power ( that's how my slaes partner does it). this then leads to a whatsapp convo, site visit etc ( we still need to go through a process where I interview him and ask him question regarding his process) 
- Can you do a quick rough TAM alculation/search to make sure we can do this?
- Call me FT instead of Nicholas 
- I like the idea of us having to do some parts manually in order to get the reall nuggets that will later be automated 
- No need to say Ref: Vibe X

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Right, FT, let's get this user flow updated to reflect your current lead generation approach, incorporate the manual learning aspect you like, and make it more robust with a quick look at the Total Addressable Market (TAM). And no more "Ref: Vibe X"!

First, I'll do a quick web search to get a rough idea of the TAM in Nigeria for businesses needing power solutions. This will help us understand if the 20 calls/week target is realistic with a broader outreach.

Okay, FT, based on the search:

*   **Manufacturing Sector:** The manufacturing sector in Nigeria is significant, with key areas like automotive, consumer goods, chemicals/petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) represents around 2000 companies (Commonwealth of Nations). Lusha lists 57 manufacturing companies specifically. Lagos Free Zone highlights growth in these areas, noting both challenges (currency crisis impacting consumer goods) and opportunities (Dangote Refinery boosting petrochemicals, government incentives).
*   **Other Potential Sectors:** While manufacturing is a strong candidate, remember to consider other power-hungry sectors like large-scale agriculture, healthcare facilities, hospitality (hotels, resorts), and real estate development (large commercial/residential complexes).

**TAM Conclusion (Quick Estimate):**
Even with conservative estimates focusing *only* on a fraction of the manufacturing sector, plus a portion of other key industries, the number of potential businesses needing reliable power solutions in Nigeria is certainly in the **many thousands, if not tens of thousands**.

*   If MAN represents 2000 companies, and even if only 20-30% are prime targets for your specific solutions at any given time, that's 400-600 companies just from that association.
*   Add to this other large manufacturing firms not in MAN, plus companies in healthcare, large agriculture, major hotels, and new real estate projects.
*   The Lagos Free Zone article also mentions the government's push for local production and incentives, which implies new and expanding businesses needing power.

So, a TAM in the thousands to low tens of thousands seems very plausible. To book 20 calls a week (around 80 a month), with a conservative positive reply rate (e.g., 2-3%) from cold outreach, you'd need to be reaching out to a few thousand unique companies per month. This seems feasible given the potential market size, especially if you rinse and repeat lists every few months as suggested in one of your "Vibe" examples.

Now, I'll update the user flow document, `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`, to reflect your current sales process, your preference for some manual steps, and the TAM insights. I'll use "FT" instead of "Nicholas".

Here's the plan for the `user_flow_v2.md` update:

1.  **Rename User:** Change "Nicholas" to "FT".
2.  **Integrate Current Sales Process:** Add an initial phase that reflects lead generation through social events and personal networking, leading to WhatsApp, site visits etc. This will be the "manual nugget gathering" phase.
3.  **Refine TAM Section:** Briefly incorporate the TAM findings.
4.  **Clarify Manual Steps:** Explicitly mention where manual review and intervention are crucial for learning and quality, even if future automation is possible.
5.  **Remove "Ref: Vibe X":** As requested.

Let's get that updated.

+ **Core Principles:**
+ *   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine proven networking/event-based lead generation with a scalable, semi-automated outreach system.
+ *   **Volume & TAM:** To achieve the target of 20 *additional* calls/week via outreach, a significant Total Addressable Market (TAM) is needed. Initial estimates suggest a TAM of many thousands of Nigerian businesses across manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, hospitality, and real estate, making this feasible.
+ *   **Systematisation for Scale:** Rely on defined processes and tools for the scalable part of lead generation.
+ *   **Message-Market Fit:** Continuously test and refine messaging for specific industry segments, learning from both manual interactions and automated campaign results.
+ *   **AI Leverage (Strategic):** Utilise AI for tasks like data enrichment, initial personalisation assistance, and pattern identification where it adds efficiency without sacrificing quality.
+ *   **Focus on Outcomes:** All activities should directly contribute to booking calls with qualified leads.
+ *   **Manual Insight Gathering:** Deliberately include manual steps in the automated flow to capture nuanced insights, refine targeting, and understand customer pain points directly, which can then inform future automation.
  
  **Assumptions:**
- *   News articles, company databases (e.g., Apollo.io), and industry reports can indicate a company's likelihood to need power solutions.
+ *   Personal interactions at events build strong initial rapport.
+ *   A systematic outreach process can effectively supplement event-based lead generation.

Excellent, FT. The user flow in `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md` has been updated.

It now starts with your proven networking and relationship-building approach (Phase 0) and then details how a more scalable, semi-automated outreach system (Phases 1-4) can supplement that to hit the 20 additional calls per week.

Key changes:
*   Your name is now FT.
*   Phase 0 reflects your current event-based networking and WhatsApp follow-up.
*   The crucial role of "Manual Insight Gathering" is highlighted throughout, ensuring that your direct interactions continuously improve the automated parts.
*   The TAM discussion is now more integrated.
*   The "Ref: Vibe X" notes are gone.
*   The "Open Questions" now include how to best capture insights from your networking and the need to formally interview you (as the sales partner) to codify what's already working.

Have a read through this version. How does this align with your vision for blending your current successful methods with a more scalable outreach engine? Are there any specific manual checkpoints or feedback loops you'd like to detail further?

The next natural step would be to dive into some of those "Open Questions," particularly how we can systematically capture the "nuggets" from your Phase 0 activities to make the automated outreach (Phases 1-4) smarter.

_**User**_

- No, my role ( although it will involving me talking to SOME PEOPLE) is notto network, that is what my sales partner does. I am building the system that books us call to sell
- I will not be persoanlly using Sales Nav, but if there's a tool that looks there I will consider it
- If the TAM is like 2000 how did yo uget tens of thousand? Look deeper online with web ( multiple runs of searches 
- Have you accounted for using the vibes but also the context and cultural aspect that is Nigeria also? 

Redo your writeup

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Understood, FT. Thanks for the clarifications. My apologies for misinterpreting your role and the TAM figures. Let's get this right.

**Revisiting TAM & Your Role**

You're the architect of the lead generation *system*, and your sales partner is the one doing the face-to-face networking. The system you build will be the engine for scaling call booking beyond that.

I'll do a more thorough job on the TAM. You're right to question the initial jump to "tens of thousands" if a primary source indicated ~2000 for a specific segment like MAN. My previous estimate was a broader extrapolation, but we need more concrete figures or at least a better-justified range.

I'll conduct a few more targeted web searches to get a better sense of the market size across various relevant sectors in Nigeria.

**TAM Search - Round 2**
I'll search for data on:
*   Broader business counts in Nigeria.
*   Specific numbers for power-hungry sectors like larger hospitals, hotels, and agricultural businesses.

**Revised TAM Estimates & User Flow Update**

Okay, FT, I've done some more digging. Here's what I've found regarding potential market size:

*   **Registered Businesses:** Nigeria has a very large number of registered businesses. The Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) reported over 3.1 million registered companies as of 2019, and newer data from various sources like Learnark suggest figures closer to 4.9 million on the total register (though "effective" or active numbers might be lower). [Source: CAC, Learnark]
*   **Hospitals:** There are tens of thousands of health facilities. Sources like Punch NG and Learnark, referencing Federal Ministry of Health data, indicate around 40,000 functional hospitals and clinics (public and private). Thehospitalbook.com lists over 38,000. [Source: Punch NG, Learnark, Thehospitalbook.com, U.S. International Trade Administration]
*   **Hotels:** The number of hotels is also substantial. Rentechdigital.com estimates over 14,000 hotels in Nigeria as of May 2025. Statista also indicates a large and growing market, though it focuses more on revenue and user penetration. [Source: Rentechdigital.com, Statista, Aninver.com]
*   **Agriculture:** This sector is huge, with agriculture accounting for about 24% of Nigeria's GDP. While many are smallholder farms (around 80% of the agricultural labor force), there's also a significant number of larger agricultural businesses involved in production and processing. Pinpointing an exact number of "large" businesses that would be prime candidates for independent power solutions is harder, but the overall sector size is vast. [Source: U.S. International Trade Administration, Statista, BusinessDay.ng]

**Conclusion on TAM:**
Even if we are very conservative and only consider a fraction of these numbers as genuinely needing *your specific* power solutions (e.g., medium to large businesses within these sectors that are not already fully self-sufficient or have unreliable grid access), the potential market is certainly in the **many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands.** This is more than enough to support your goal of 20 qualified calls per week through a systematic approach. My initial "tens of thousands" was a broad stroke, but it seems well-supported now.

**Nigerian Context & Vibe Integration:**
You're absolutely right to bring this up. The "vibes" (the shared examples) offer excellent tactical ideas, but they must be adapted. The Nigerian context means:
*   **Relationship is Key:** Even with a system, the "human touch" and trust are paramount. Your sales partner's current approach is gold. The system should *support and scale* that, not replace it.
*   **Power is a Critical Need:** This isn't a luxury. Businesses *need* reliable power. This is a strong selling point.
*   **Trust & Verification:** Decision-makers will likely want to verify claims and people. Credibility is crucial.
*   **Communication Styles:** WhatsApp is prevalent, as you noted. Formal emails are good, but follow-up might happen via more informal channels.
*   **Logistics & Infrastructure:** Site visits are important, and understanding the local infrastructure challenges for any power installation is key.

I will now update the user flow document, `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`, incorporating these points: FT's role is system architect, sales partner handles networking, revised TAM understanding, and more explicit integration of the Nigerian context with the tactical "vibe" ideas. I will remove the "Ref: Vibe X" annotations.

  # User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v2)
  
- **User:** FT (System Owner/Operator & Sales Partner)
+ **User:** FT (System Architect & Process Owner) & Sales Partner (Networking & Closing)
  
- **Primary Goal:** Book 20 qualified sales calls per week for power solutions (generators, IPPs), supplementing existing networking-based lead generation.
+ **Primary Goal:** Systematically generate and qualify leads to enable the Sales Partner to book 20 qualified sales calls per week for power solutions (generators, IPPs), supplementing the Sales Partner's existing networking-based lead generation.
  
  **Core Principles:**
- *   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine proven networking/event-based lead generation with a scalable, semi-automated outreach system.
- *   **Volume & TAM:** To achieve the target of 20 *additional* calls/week via outreach, a significant Total Addressable Market (TAM) is needed. Initial estimates suggest a TAM of many thousands of Nigerian businesses across manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, hospitality, and real estate, making this feasible.
- *   **Systematisation for Scale:** Rely on defined processes and tools for the scalable part of lead generation.
- *   **Message-Market Fit:** Continuously test and refine messaging for specific industry segments, learning from both manual interactions and automated campaign results.
- *   **AI Leverage (Strategic):** Utilise AI for tasks like data enrichment, initial personalisation assistance, and pattern identification where it adds efficiency without sacrificing quality.
- *   **Focus on Outcomes:** All activities should directly contribute to booking calls with qualified leads.
- *   **Manual Insight Gathering:** Deliberately include manual steps in the automated flow to capture nuanced insights, refine targeting, and understand customer pain points directly, which can then inform future automation.
+ *   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine the Sales Partner's proven networking/event-based lead generation with a scalable, FT-designed and managed semi-automated outreach system. The system's role is to feed the Sales Partner high-quality, pre-qualified opportunities.
+ *   **Robust TAM:** The Nigerian market presents a substantial Total Addressable Market. With millions of registered businesses and tens of thousands of entities in power-hungry sectors like manufacturing (thousands), healthcare (~40,000 hospitals/clinics), hospitality (~14,000+ hotels), and large-scale agriculture, achieving 20 additional qualified calls weekly via systematic outreach is feasible.
+ *   **Systematisation for Scale (FT's Domain):** Rely on defined processes, data management, and tools (selected and implemented by FT) for the scalable part of lead generation.
+ *   **Message-Market Fit (Nigerian Context):** Continuously test and refine messaging for specific industry segments. Messaging must resonate with Nigerian business needs, emphasizing reliability, cost-savings, and understanding of local operational challenges (e.g., impact of power unreliability). Learn from both the Sales Partner's direct interactions and automated campaign results.
+ *   **AI Leverage (Strategic & Supervised by FT):** Utilise AI for tasks like data enrichment, initial personalisation assistance, and pattern identification where it adds efficiency without sacrificing the quality and trust essential in the Nigerian market.
+ *   **Focus on Outcomes:** All system activities, managed by FT, should directly contribute to providing the Sales Partner with leads ready for a meaningful sales conversation.
+ *   **Manual Insight Gathering (Synergy):**
+     *   **Sales Partner's Role:** The Sales Partner continues to gather deep insights from events and direct interactions (Phase 0). These insights (pain points, successful angles, objections, decision-maker personas) are crucial and must be systematically fed back to FT.
+     *   **FT's Role:** Deliberately include FT-reviewed checkpoints in the "automated" flow to capture nuanced insights, refine targeting, understand customer pain points from system-generated leads, and improve AI/automation effectiveness.
  
  **Assumptions:**
- *   Personal interactions at events build strong initial rapport.
- *   A systematic outreach process can effectively supplement event-based lead generation.
- *   News articles, company databases, and industry reports can indicate a company's likelihood to need power solutions.
- *   Targeted, semi-automated outreach is more effective than generic blasts.
- *   Personalisation, even light, significantly increases response rates from cold outreach.
+ *   The Sales Partner's personal interactions at events build strong initial rapport and are a primary source of high-value deals.
+ *   An FT-managed systematic outreach process can effectively supplement and scale lead generation.
+ *   Publicly available data (news, company databases, industry reports), when enriched and filtered, can indicate a company's likelihood to need power solutions.
+ *   Targeted, semi-automated outreach, with messaging adapted for Nigerian cultural and business norms, is more effective than generic blasts. Personalisation, even light but contextually relevant, increases response rates.
+ *   Credibility and trust are paramount; the system must support this.

+     *   **Details:** For "High Potential Companies" validated by Sales Partner, FT or an assistant manually (or using targeted tools like LinkedIn search for *roles*, then attempting to find email patterns/validation) identifies specific names and email addresses for relevant roles (Operations Director, MD, Chief Engineer, Procurement Head). This is a critical step requiring human oversight for accuracy in the Nigerian context.
+     *   **Output:** A list of target contacts with verified (as much as possible) details for the outreach campaign.
+ 
+ 7.  **Action (System - AI-Assisted by FT / Manual by FT):** AI-Assisted Personalisation Snippet Generation
+     *   **Tools (Managed by FT):** Make.com/Zapier + LLM (GPT-4, Claude) if deemed effective and cost-efficient by FT.
+     *   **Process (System):** For the target contacts, FT's system (or FT manually) uses key data (company name, industry, relevant news snippet) to generate potential icebreakers or opening lines for emails/messages.
+     *   **Prompt Engineering (FT):** FT crafts and refines prompts to generate culturally appropriate, professional, and relevant snippets. Focus on value proposition for Nigerian businesses.
+     *   **FT Review & Approval:** FT *must* review, edit, and approve ALL AI-generated snippets. This ensures relevance, appropriate tone for Nigerian business communication, brand voice, and provides direct feedback for improving prompts. The aim is "good enough" personalisation that feels genuine.
  
- 7.  **Action (System/FT):** Email Campaign Execution
-     *   **Tools:** Instantly.ai, Mailshake, or similar cold email platform with pre-warmed inboxes.
+ 8.  **Action (System - Managed by FT, on behalf of Sales Partner):** Email Campaign Execution
+     *   **Tools (Managed by FT):** Cold email platform (e.g., Instantly.ai, Mailshake) with pre-warmed inboxes and domains.
      *   **Process (FT):**
-         *   Set up email sequences (leveraging insights from Phase 0 manual interactions).
-         *   Load approved leads with their personalised snippets into the campaign.
-     *   **Value Proposition:** Clearly articulate how power solutions address pain points (informed by Phase 0).
-     *   **CTA:** Soft CTA (e.g., "Open to a brief chat?" or "Mind if I send a short Loom video?").
-     *   **System:** Sends emails, tracks opens, clicks, replies.
+         *   FT sets up email sequences (1-3 emails). Copywriting leverages insights from Sales Partner's Phase 0 interactions and Nigerian business communication norms.
+         *   FT loads approved leads (companies + contacts + personalised snippets) into the campaign. Emails are sent appearing to be from the Sales Partner (or a generic company address leading to Sales Partner).
+     *   **Value Proposition:** Clearly articulate how your power solutions address specific Nigerian business pain points (e.g., "reduce diesel costs," "ensure continuous production," "power your expansion").
+     *   **CTA:** Soft, culturally appropriate CTA (e.g., "Would you be open to a brief introductory call to see if we can help?" or "May I share some information on how we've assisted similar businesses in [City/Industry]?").
+     *   **System (Managed by FT):** Sends emails, tracks opens, clicks, replies. FT monitors these metrics.
  
- ## Phase 4: Engagement & Call Booking (from Outreach)
+ ## Phase 4: Engagement & Call Booking (Sales Partner Lead, FT System Support)
  
- 8.  **Action (FT):** Manage Positive Replies & Book Calls
-     *   **Details:** Monitor inbox for replies from outreach campaigns. Respond promptly.
-     *   Use a scheduling tool (Calendly, SavvyCal).
-     *   Qualify further during the initial positive interaction.
-     *   **Goal:** Convert positive replies into 20 *additional* booked calls per week.
+ 9.  **Action (Sales Partner, with FT Support):** Manage Positive Replies & Book Calls
+     *   **Details (Sales Partner):** Sales Partner takes over managing positive replies from outreach campaigns. Responds promptly, often via email initially, potentially moving to WhatsApp/call as per Nigerian norms.
+     *   **Details (FT):** FT ensures the system efficiently flags positive replies and funnels them to the Sales Partner.
+     *   **Qualification (Sales Partner):** Sales Partner further qualifies the lead during this initial interaction, referencing information gathered by FT's system.
+     *   **Booking (Sales Partner):** Uses a scheduling tool (Calendly, SavvyCal) for efficiency.
+     *   **Goal:** Convert positive replies from the system-driven outreach into 20 *additional* booked calls per week for the Sales Partner.
  
- 9.  **Action (System/FT):** Track Metrics & Iterate (Across All Phases)
-     *   **Metrics:**
-         *   Phase 0: Number of event leads, WhatsApp conversations initiated, site visits, proposals from networking.
-         *   Phases 1-4: Emails sent, open rate, reply rate, positive reply rate, calls booked from outreach.

-         *   Which email angles/segments yielded most positive replies/calls?
-         *   Adjust TAM targeting, lead scoring, AI prompts, and email copy based on performance from *both* networking and outreach.
-     *   **Feedback Loop:** Insights from Phase 0 directly inform messaging and targeting for Phases 1-4. Successes/failures in automated outreach can also highlight new conversation starters for networking.
+ 10. **Action (FT & Sales Partner):** Track Metrics & Iterate (Across All Phases)
+     *   **Metrics (Tracked by FT, Reviewed with Sales Partner):**
+         *   Phase 0: Number of event leads, WhatsApp conversations initiated, site visits, proposals from networking (Sales Partner provides data).
+         *   Phases 1-4 (System): Leads sourced, enrichment success rate, companies qualified by FT, contacts identified, emails sent, open rate, reply rate, positive reply rate, calls booked from outreach.
+     *   **Process (FT & Sales Partner):** Weekly review of all metrics.
+         *   Compare effectiveness of Sales Partner's networking vs. FT's system-driven outreach.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

Okay, FT, I've updated the user flow in `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`.

Here’s a summary of the key changes:
*   **Your Role:** Clearly defined as the "System Architect & Process Owner."
*   **Sales Partner's Role:** Emphasised as handling networking, relationship building, and closing, while providing crucial market insights back to you.
*   **TAM:** Updated with the more robust findings, confirming a large potential market.
*   **Nigerian Context:** Woven throughout the flow, especially in sections on messaging, communication, trust-building, and the importance of the Sales Partner's insights.
*   **Tool Usage:** Clarified that tools like LinkedIn would be used by you for research/company identification, not necessarily requiring a Sales Navigator seat for your role. Tool selection and management fall under your responsibilities.
*   **Lead Sourcing & Contact ID:** Made the distinction clearer between sourcing *companies* (which can be more automated) and then identifying specific *contact persons* (which often requires more manual oversight/skill in the Nigerian context).
*   **AI Usage:** Positioned as a tool *you* manage and supervise, with a strong emphasis on your review and refinement of any AI-generated content to ensure it's culturally appropriate and high quality.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Strengthened the feedback mechanisms between your system's findings and the Sales Partner's on-the-ground intelligence.

Please review the updated `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v2.md`. This version aims to be a more accurate reflection of how your system will operate in synergy with your sales partner, tailored to the realities of the Nigerian market.

Let me know your thoughts!

- Sales Partner is called Munaj 

- Remove things like "(Ref: Vibe 1 - Apollo.io usage)" from @user_flow_v2.md 

- This "action" and "process" doesn't read great 

- The company we work for ( Mikano ) is fairly well known in Nigeria

+ # User Flow: Automated Lead Generation (v3)
+ 
+ **User:** FT (System Architect & Process Owner) & Munaj (Sales Partner)
+ 
+ **Primary Goal:** Systematically generate and qualify leads to enable Munaj to book 20 qualified sales calls per week for Mikano power solutions (generators, IPPs), supplementing Munaj's existing networking-based lead generation.
+ 
+ **Core Principles:**
+ *   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine Munaj's proven networking/event-based lead generation with a scalable, FT-designed and managed semi-automated outreach system. The system's role is to feed Munaj high-quality, pre-qualified opportunities.
+ *   **Robust TAM:** The Nigerian market presents a substantial Total Addressable Market. With millions of registered businesses and tens of thousands of entities in power-hungry sectors like manufacturing (thousands), healthcare (~40,000 hospitals/clinics), hospitality (~14,000+ hotels), and large-scale agriculture, achieving 20 additional qualified calls weekly via systematic outreach is feasible.
+ *   **Systematisation for Scale (FT's Domain):** Build defined processes, data management, and tools for the scalable part of lead generation.
+ *   **Message-Market Fit (Nigerian Context):** Test and refine messaging for specific industry segments. Messaging must resonate with Nigerian business needs, emphasizing reliability, cost-savings, and understanding of local operational challenges (e.g., impact of power unreliability). Learn from both Munaj's direct interactions and campaign results.
+ *   **AI Leverage (Strategic):** Use AI where it adds efficiency without sacrificing the quality and trust essential in the Nigerian market.
+ *   **Focus on Outcomes:** All system activities should directly contribute to providing Munaj with leads ready for a meaningful sales conversation.
+ *   **Manual Insight Collection:**
+     *   **Munaj's Role:** Continue gathering deep insights from events and direct interactions. These insights (pain points, successful angles, objections, decision-maker personas) inform system improvements.
+     *   **FT's Role:** Regularly review automated processes to capture insights, refine targeting, and understand customer pain points from system-generated leads.
+ 
+ **Assumptions:**
+ *   Munaj's personal interactions at events build strong initial rapport and are a primary source of high-value deals.
+ *   An FT-managed systematic outreach process can effectively supplement and scale lead generation.
+ *   Publicly available data (news, company databases, industry reports), when enriched and filtered, can indicate a company's likelihood to need power solutions.
+ *   Targeted, semi-automated outreach, with messaging adapted for Nigerian cultural and business norms, is more effective than generic blasts.
+ *   Mikano's brand recognition in Nigeria provides credibility that can be leveraged in outreach.
+ *   The questionnaire process provides valuable qualification data but requires manual handling.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Phase 0: Relationship-Driven Lead Generation (Munaj's Primary Method)
+ 
+ **Trigger:** Munaj attends social/industry events, leverages personal network.
+ 
+ 1.  **Networking & Initial Conversations (Munaj)**
+     *   Discuss Mikano power solutions, identify potential needs through conversation, build rapport.
+     *   Potential leads expressing initial interest.
+     *   Share general themes, common questions, and types of companies showing interest with FT to inform system targeting.
+ 
+ 2.  **Transition to Direct Communication (Munaj)**
+     *   Exchange contact details, typically leading to WhatsApp conversations or calls.
+     *   Build ongoing dialogue and relationship.
+ 
+ 3.  **Deeper Qualification & Site Visits (Munaj)**
+     *   Understand specific needs, power challenges, budget considerations. May involve site visits.
+     *   Send the Mikano questionnaire to gather specific technical requirements.
+     *   Log key information from these interactions detailing customer pain points, decision drivers, successful arguments, and reasons for lost deals. FT uses this to refine system messaging and targeting.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## Phase 1: Market Identification & Lead Sourcing (FT-Managed System)
+ 
+ **Trigger:** Ongoing process, reviewed weekly by FT, with input from Munaj.
+ 
+ 1.  **Define & Refine Target Market Segments (FT with Munaj's Input)**
+     *   Based on Munaj's successes and market research, identify primary industries in Nigeria with high power needs (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, large-scale agriculture, hospitality, real estate development, education).
+     *   Explore vertical (upmarket/downmarket) and horizontal (adjacent industries) expansion opportunities.
+     *   Define ideal company profiles (size, locations/states, specific triggers like "new factory," "expansion plans," "reported power issues," "reliance on expensive diesel generators").
+     *   Store these definitions as searchable profiles/criteria.
+ 
+ 2.  **High-Volume Lead Sourcing (FT System / Manual)**
+     *   Use company databases (local directories, industry-specific databases, custom web scraping).
+     *   Define search criteria based on market segments.
+     *   Extract lead lists (company name, website, industry, location, relevant contact titles).
+     *   Store in a central database managed by FT.
+     *   FT periodically reviews lists to spot-check relevance and assess data quality.
+ 
+ 3.  **Initial Data Cleaning (FT System)**
+     *   Remove obvious duplicates and incomplete entries from the sourced list.
+     *   Present a cleaner list of potential companies for enrichment.
+ 
+ ## Phase 2: Enrichment & Qualification (FT System with Oversight)
+ 
+ 4.  **Company & Contact Enrichment (FT System)**
+     *   For each company, gather:
+         *   More detailed industry classification
+         *   Specific news mentions related to expansion, power challenges, new projects (Nigerian sources prioritized)
+         *   Identify likely key contact persons/departments (Operations, Procurement, Engineering, C-level)
+     *   Populate richer company profiles
+     *   FT reviews samples weekly to validate data quality and ensure automation is capturing useful information for the Nigerian context
+ 
+ 5.  **Lead Scoring & Prioritisation (FT System with Munaj's Validation)**
+     *   Score leads based on:
+         *   Industry match (weighted by known power needs)
+         *   Recent relevant news (e.g., expansion, power complaints)
+         *   Indication of company size or energy consumption
+         *   Completeness of company data
+     *   FT reviews top-scored companies and adds qualification notes based on quick research
+     *   Munaj provides a quick review of "High Potential Companies" based on market intuition before detailed contact research
+     *   Sort companies by score and flag for follow-up
+ 
+ ## Phase 3: Contact Identification & Outreach (FT System, Munaj's Brand)
+ 
+ 6.  **Identify Key Contact Persons (FT/Assistant)**
+     *   For high-potential companies validated by Munaj, identify specific names and email addresses for relevant roles (Operations Director, MD, Chief Engineer, Procurement Head)
+     *   Create a list of target contacts with verified details for the outreach campaign
+ 
+ 7.  **Personalization Development (FT with AI Assistance)**
+     *   For target contacts, use key data (company name, industry, relevant news snippet) to generate potential opening lines for emails
+     *   FT crafts, refines, and reviews all messaging to ensure relevance and appropriate tone for Nigerian business communication
+     *   Focus on value propositions specific to Mikano's offerings and Nigerian businesses
+ 
+ 8.  **Email Campaign Execution (FT System on behalf of Munaj)**
+     *   Set up email sequences (1-3 emails) that leverage insights from Munaj's interactions and Nigerian business communication norms
+     *   Load approved leads into the campaign
+     *   Emails sent appearing to be from Munaj (or Mikano)
+     *   Clearly articulate how Mikano power solutions address specific Nigerian business pain points
+     *   Use culturally appropriate calls to action
+     *   Track opens, clicks, and replies
+ 
+ ## Phase 4: Engagement & Qualification (Munaj Lead, FT Support)
+ 
+ 9.  **Manage Positive Replies (Munaj with FT Support)**
+     *   Munaj takes over managing positive replies from outreach campaigns
+     *   Responds promptly, often via email initially, potentially moving to WhatsApp/call as per Nigerian norms
+     *   FT ensures the system efficiently flags positive replies for Munaj
+     *   Munaj further qualifies leads during initial interactions
+     *   Send the Mikano questionnaire to gather technical requirements when appropriate
+     *   Convert positive replies into booked calls
+ 
+ 10. **Metrics Tracking & Iteration (FT & Munaj)**
+     *   Track metrics across all phases:
+         *   Phase 0: Number of event leads, WhatsApp conversations, site visits, proposals from networking
+         *   Phases 1-4: Leads sourced, enrichment success rate, qualified companies, contacts identified, emails sent, open rate, reply rate, calls booked
+     *   Weekly review of all metrics
+     *   Compare effectiveness of Munaj's networking vs. FT's system-driven outreach
+     *   Analyze which approaches yield most positive replies/calls
+     *   Adjust targeting, lead scoring criteria, and email messaging based on performance
+     *   Ensure Munaj's insights from networking inform FT's system refinement
+ 
+ ---

I've created `Documents/LeadGen_Dev/user_flow_v3.md` with the requested changes:

1. Removed the confusing checkpoint reference
2. Changed "Sales Partner" to "Munaj" throughout
3. Removed all "Ref: Vibe X" references
4. Improved the readability by simplifying the "action" and "process" sections
5. Added Mikano's brand recognition in Nigeria
6. Included references to the questionnaire process

The new flow is more streamlined and readable. I've:
- Simplified the headings and structure
- Made the roles clearer (who does what)
- Added Mikano branding throughout
- Integrated the questionnaire at appropriate points in the process
- Removed unnecessary parenthetical references

Would you like me to make any additional changes to this user flow document?

_**User**_

- don't think munaj will always be the primary source of leads. By going to the networking social things he gets to rub shoulders with decisons makers. But those are gov and manaufacturing people generally and not hospitals/clincs, large scale agriculture etc

- The emails will be sent from my account. Or is there a reaason why Munaj will be used to send the emails?

-     *   FT ensures the system efficiently flags positive replies for Munaj  --🔹COMMENT:how would this work? just tell me in the chat and then in a quick way in v4 document 

-  I've attached two screenshots that show the questionaire 

- How many emails will I need to send out? Does it have to be from the Mikano email or can we get our own domain? The company ( and IT admin ) use outlook which is annoying because i recenly found @https://mailr.io/# 

- the next steps at the bottom need to be further broken down into subtask.

- FT to interview Munaj to document successful strategies and objections  --🔹COMMENT:before next week wednesday i'm hoping todo this  

- what do you feel is missing from here?

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀.

I'll create a v4 version addressing all your feedback. First, let me address your specific questions:

### How would "flagging positive replies" work?
The system would use a combination of:
1. Email filters/rules set up in your inbox to automatically tag or move emails containing positive response indicators
2. A dedicated email address monitored by you where replies are sent
3. Potentially using an email platform (like Instantly.ai) that has built-in reply detection and notification systems
4. Regular manual checks by you or an assistant of the campaign inbox

### About email sending
You're right to question this. Since you'll be managing the system, the emails should come from your account rather than Munaj's. Using mailr.io is an interesting alternative to the corporate Outlook system. It offers better deliverability and scalability (based on their 99 inboxes per domain model).

For volume: Assuming a 1-2% positive response rate (industry standard for targeted cold outreach), to get 20 qualified calls per week (80/month), you'd need approximately:
- 4,000-8,000 emails per month
- 1,000-2,000 per week

This would be manageable with mailr.io's starter plan ($120/month for 2 domains, 198 mailboxes, 30k/month sending).

Let me create the v4 document with these adjustments:

+ ### Channel 2: Systematic Outreach Lead Generation (FT's Focus)
+ 
+ **Trigger:** Ongoing process, reviewed weekly by FT, with input from Munaj.
+ 
+ #### Phase 1: Market Identification & Lead Sourcing
+ 
+ 1.  **Define & Refine Target Market Segments (FT with Munaj's Input)**
+     *   Identify primary industries in Nigeria with high power needs, particularly those less reached through networking (e.g., healthcare, agriculture, hospitality, education).
+     *   Explore vertical (upmarket/downmarket) and horizontal (adjacent industries) expansion opportunities.
+     *   Define ideal company profiles (size, locations/states, specific triggers like "new factory," "expansion plans," "reported power issues").
+     *   Store these definitions as searchable profiles/criteria.
+ 
+ 2.  **High-Volume Lead Sourcing (FT System / Manual)**
+     *   Use company databases (local directories, industry-specific databases, custom web scraping).
+     *   Define search criteria based on market segments.
+     *   Extract lead lists (company name, website, industry, location, relevant contact titles).
+     *   Store in a central database managed by FT.
+     *   FT periodically reviews lists to spot-check relevance and assess data quality.
+ 
+ 3.  **Initial Data Cleaning (FT System)**
+     *   Remove obvious duplicates and incomplete entries from the sourced list.
+     *   Present a cleaner list of potential companies for enrichment.

+     *   For each company, gather:
+         *   More detailed industry classification
+         *   Specific news mentions related to expansion, power challenges, new projects (Nigerian sources prioritized)
+         *   Identify likely key contact persons/departments (Operations, Procurement, Engineering, C-level)
+     *   Populate richer company profiles
+     *   FT reviews samples weekly to validate data quality and ensure automation is capturing useful information for the Nigerian context
+ 
+ 5.  **Lead Scoring & Prioritisation (FT System with Munaj's Input)**
+     *   Score leads based on:
+         *   Industry match (weighted by known power needs)
+         *   Recent relevant news (e.g., expansion, power complaints)
+         *   Indication of company size or energy consumption
+         *   Completeness of company data
+     *   FT reviews top-scored companies and adds qualification notes based on quick research
+     *   Munaj provides occasional input on "High Potential Companies" based on market intuition

+     *   Create a list of target contacts with verified details for the outreach campaign
+ 
+ 7.  **Personalization Development (FT with AI Assistance)**
+     *   For target contacts, use key data (company name, industry, relevant news snippet) to generate potential opening lines for emails
+     *   FT crafts, refines, and reviews all messaging to ensure relevance and appropriate tone for Nigerian business communication
+     *   Focus on value propositions specific to Mikano's offerings and Nigerian businesses
+ 
+ 8.  **Email Campaign Execution (FT)**
+     *   Set up email sequences (1-3 emails) leveraging insights from successful interactions
+     *   Send using FT's email account (either via Mikano email or a dedicated domain with mailr.io)
+     *   Volume: Target 1,000-2,000 emails per week (to achieve ~20 qualified calls/week)
+     *   Clearly articulate how Mikano power solutions address specific Nigerian business pain points
+     *   Use culturally appropriate calls to action
+     *   Track opens, clicks, and replies
+ 
+ #### Phase 4: Engagement & Qualification
+ 
+ 9.  **Manage Positive Replies (FT with Munaj's Support)**
+     *   **Reply Detection System:**
+         *   Set up email filters/rules to automatically tag and highlight replies

+ 
+ 10. **Metrics Tracking & Iteration (FT & Munaj)**
+     *   Track metrics across all channels:
+         *   Channel 1: Number of event leads, WhatsApp conversations, site visits, proposals from networking
+         *   Channel 2: Leads sourced, enrichment success rate, qualified companies, contacts identified, emails sent, open rate, reply rate, calls booked
+     *   Weekly review of all metrics
+     *   Compare effectiveness of different lead sources and approaches
+     *   Analyze which approaches yield most positive replies/calls

I've created v4 with significant improvements based on your feedback. Major changes include:

### Structure Improvements
- Reframed as "parallel lead generation approaches" with clearer role separation
- Added a dedicated "Technical Qualification Process" section highlighting the questionnaire
- Created a detailed "Action Plan for Implementation" with timing-based subtasks
- Better acknowledged the sectoral focus differences (Munaj: gov/manufacturing, FT: healthcare/agriculture/etc.)

### Email & Reply System Clarifications
- Specified that emails will come from your account (FT)
- Added realistic volume estimates (1,000-2,000 emails/week)
- Included mailr.io pricing and capacity information
- Added a specific "Reply Detection System" explaining how positive replies would be flagged:
  - Email filters/rules
  - Platform-based tracking
  - Scheduled checking times
  - Folder/tagging system

### What Was Missing
- A clear technical qualification process section
- Specific implementation timelines (now broken into 7-day, 14-day, 30-day actions)
- Email volume estimates and infrastructure requirements
- Concrete first steps for the Munaj interview
- Daily/weekly/monthly ongoing tasks

The questionnaire is now properly integrated throughout the flow. I've mentioned it in the technical qualification process, included a step to digitize it for easier use, and referenced it at appropriate points in both channels.

The implementation plan acknowledges your timeline for interviewing Munaj before Wednesday and breaks down the "next steps" into much more actionable items with timeframes.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to expand on or modify further in this v4 document?
