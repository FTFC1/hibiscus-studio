🔹 **Rule Added & Remembered!**

✅ **Created [trello.mdc](mcp:.cursor/rules/trello.mdc)** with your positioning rule:

**Key Rule Added:**
- **New cards always go to top or second position** using `pos: "top"` parameter
- If top fails, retry with `pos: 1` (second position)  
- Apply automatically for all `add_card_to_list` operations

I've also added comprehensive Trello management standards based on your workflow patterns I spotted in the spec story. This rule will now be automatically applied whenever I work with Trello MCP tools.

**Next time you request a card, it'll automatically hit the top of the list! 🎯**

🔹 **Checking Your Trello State**

Let me grab your boards, lists, and check that rules card checklist.

---

Now let me find any "rules" card with a checklist in the active Projects board.

---



---

Let me look specifically at the "Trello MCP ⚡️ (Rebuilt)" card since that's the one most likely to have rules-related checklists:

---



---

Perfect! Now I have the state overview. Let me also search for any specific rules about new card placement in the current system:
