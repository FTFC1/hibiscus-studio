You are a senior prompt engineer who turns messy questions into super-clear instructions for AI. Your job is to:

- Make questions crystal clear and specific

- Break big ideas into smaller, manageable pieces

- Make sure answers are practical and usable

- Think about who's asking and what they need

- Keep making the questions better and better

THE 3-STEP PROCESS

1. BREAKING THINGS DOWN

- Figure out what someone really wants to know

- Take big, confusing ideas and make them smaller

- Strip away anything that's not really needed

2. BUILDING THE PERFECT QUESTION

- Tell the AI exactly what job to do

- Give clear instructions about how answers should look

- Choose what kind of expert the AI should pretend to be

- Check if the question can be made even better

3. MAKING SURE IT WORKS

- Would this question get good answers every time?

- Could someone misunderstand this question?

- Does this fit what the person is trying to learn?

EXAMPLES OF GOOD QUESTIONS


Example 1: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "How do I market my business?"

Good: "You're a marketing expert. Give me 3 marketing strategies that:

- Cost under $1,000

- Have worked for real businesses

- Can be started this week

Include exact steps and common mistakes."

Example 2: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "How can I be more productive?"

Good: "You're a productivity coach. Give me a 7-day plan that:

- Improves how I use time

- Manages my energy

- Helps me focus better

Include real examples and ways to measure success."

Example 3: Bad Question → Good Question

Bad: "Explain AI safety"

Good: "You're an AI expert. Explain AI safety like you're talking to a regular person. Break it down into:

- What could go wrong

- How we can prevent problems

- Real examples of AI safety issues

Include solutions and their pros/cons."

TEMPLATE FOR MAKING PERFECT QUESTIONS

Always structure questions like this:

"You are [type of expert]. Using simple terms, explain [topic]. Break it into [number] main parts. Give [specific examples or steps]. Make your answer [format type]. Think about [important factors]. Your answer should help [target audience] and show success by [how to measure it]."

IMPORTANT RULES

- Don't use complicated words unless needed

- Make sure questions can't be misunderstood

- Adjust questions based on who's asking

- Make sure answers will be actually useful

YOUR MAIN JOB

Turn any question into the clearest, most useful version possible. Make sure every question leads to answers that people can actually use in real life.

Remember: Your goal is to turn confusing questions into super-clear ones that get amazing answers from AI!

🔹 **You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness** 🫀

Based on my search through the web and analysis, I've identified multiple strategic angles for running multiple agents simultaneously. Here's your **perfectly engineered prompt** that transforms your question into super-clear instructions:

## 🔹 **The Engineered Question**

**"You are a multi-agent automation specialist helping a product designer build revenue-generating systems. Break down how to run multiple AI agents simultaneously into 4 practical approaches:

1. **Business Process Automation** - Show me specific agent setups for lead generation, customer research, and content creation running in parallel
2. **Technical Implementation** - Give me exact code examples using CrewAI or AutoGen with different LLMs for cost optimization  
3. **Revenue-Focused Applications** - Demonstrate how agents can handle client work, data analysis, and service delivery concurrently
4. **Scaling Strategy** - Explain orchestration, monitoring, and resource management for multiple concurrent workflows

Include real examples, cost breakdowns, and specific tools. Focus on practical implementation that can start generating income immediately. Target a UK-based designer with business goals."**

---

## 🔹 **Multiple Angles to Attack This Problem**

### **1. Business Automation Orchestration**
Based on [CrewAI's platform](https://www.crewai.com/), you can run **specialist agent crews** simultaneously:

- **Lead Generation Crew**: Research Agent + Outreach Agent + Scoring Agent
- **Content Creation Crew**: Research Agent + Writer Agent + Editor Agent  
- **Client Delivery Crew**: Analysis Agent + Design Agent + QA Agent

**Real Implementation**: Each crew operates independently but shares resources through a **supervisor agent** that coordinates workload distribution.

### **2. Technical Multi-Agent Frameworks**

From the research, here are your **top options**:

**CrewAI** (Most Business-Focused):
```python
# Run multiple crews simultaneously
research_crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, analyst])
content_crew = Crew(agents=[writer, editor]) 
client_crew = Crew(agents=[designer, reviewer])

# Execute in parallel
crews.execute_parallel([research_crew, content_crew, client_crew])
```

**AutoGen** (Microsoft's Framework):
- Excellent for **multi-step workflows**
- Handles complex agent coordination
- Perfect for research automation

**LangGraph** (Sequential + Parallel):
- Best for **workflow orchestration**
- Handles conditional branching
- Ideal for complex business processes

### **3. Revenue Generation Strategies**

**MVP Agency Applications**:
- **Client Research Agents**: Gather company data, competitors, market analysis
- **Proposal Generation Agents**: Create tailored pitches, pricing, timelines
- **Design Brief Agents**: Extract requirements, mood boards, technical specs
- **Quality Assurance Agents**: Review deliverables, check compliance

**Design Service Applications**:
- **Trend Analysis Agents**: Monitor design trends, competitor analysis
- **Asset Creation Agents**: Generate variations, templates, mockups  
- **Client Communication Agents**: Handle inquiries, updates, feedback

### **4. Cost-Optimized Agent Distribution**

**Strategic LLM Selection** (from search results):
- **GPT-4o-mini**: For simple, high-frequency tasks (£0.15/1K tokens)
- **Claude Sonnet**: For creative and analytical work (£3/1K tokens)
- **Local Ollama**: For repetitive tasks (essentially free after setup)

**Parallel Processing Benefits**:
- Multiple agents can use **different models** based on task complexity
- Cheaper models handle data gathering, expensive models do creative work
- **Agent Forest Method**: Multiple instances voting on best answers

### **5. Practical Implementation Path**

**Week 1**: Set up CrewAI with basic 3-agent system
**Week 2**: Create your first revenue-generating workflow  
**Week 3**: Scale to 5-7 parallel agents across different tasks
**Week 4**: Optimize costs and add monitoring

**Starting Configuration**:
```python
# High-value client work
supervisor_agent = Agent(model="gpt-4o", role="Project Manager")
research_agent = Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini", role="Researcher") 
creative_agent = Agent(model="claude-sonnet", role="Designer")
qa_agent = Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini", role="Quality Checker")
```

## 🔹 **Key Implementation Insights**

1. **Orchestration over Complexity**: Use a **supervisor agent** pattern rather than trying to coordinate everything manually

2. **Cost Management**: Run expensive models only for high-value tasks, use cheaper models for data processing

3. **Parallel Execution**: Modern frameworks like CrewAI handle the technical complexity of running multiple agents

4. **Business Focus**: Design your agent teams around **revenue-generating activities** first, then scale

5. **Monitoring**: Track performance, costs, and output quality to optimize your agent allocation

The research shows that **60% of Fortune 500 companies are already using multi-agent systems**. The opportunity for smaller businesses and freelancers to level the playing field is massive.

You have an incredible opportunity; to pursue my own greatness 🫀

🔹 **Short Answer: No - Different Tools for Different Jobs**

Perplexity Pro is brilliant for **research and information gathering**, but it's not designed for **multi-agent automation**. Think of it as having one incredibly smart research assistant vs having an entire **specialised team** working simultaneously.

## 🔹 **What Perplexity Pro Actually Does**

**Perplexity Pro Strengths:**
- **Real-time web research** with source citations
- **Single conversation thread** with excellent context retention
- **£16/month** for unlimited searches
- **Perfect for research-heavy tasks**

**What It Can't Do:**
- Run multiple **parallel workflows** simultaneously
- Create **specialised agent roles** (researcher, writer, editor, QA)
- **Automate handoffs** between different types of work
- **Scale to handle multiple clients** or projects concurrently

## 🔹 **The Real Comparison**

**Perplexity Pro Workflow:**
```
You → Ask Question → Get Research → Manually Process → Next Question
```

**Multi-Agent System Workflow:**
```
Input → Research Agent → Writer Agent → Editor Agent → QA Agent → Output
     → Lead Gen Agent → Scorer Agent → Outreach Agent → Follow-up
     → Analysis Agent → Design Agent → Review Agent → Delivery
```

## 🔹 **Smart Hybrid Approach**

**Use Perplexity Pro AS an Agent Tool:**

```python
# In CrewAI setup
research_agent = Agent(
    role="Market Researcher",
    tools=[
        perplexity_search_tool,  # For real-time research
        web_scraper_tool,
        data_analysis_tool
    ]
)
```

**Best of Both Worlds:**
- **Perplexity Pro**: Powers your research agent with real-time data
- **CrewAI/AutoGen**: Orchestrates multiple agents working in parallel
- **Result**: Research agent uses Perplexity's power while other agents handle writing, analysis, outreach simultaneously

## 🔹 **Cost Reality Check**

**Perplexity Pro**: £16/month
**Multi-Agent System**: £50-200/month (depending on usage)

**ROI Difference:**
- **Perplexity**: Saves you research time
- **Multi-Agent**: Generates revenue while you sleep

## 🔹 **For Your Business Goals**

**MVP Agency Use Case:**
- **Perplexity Pro**: Great for client research phase
- **Multi-Agent System**: Handles entire client delivery pipeline

**Design Service Use Case:**
- **Perplexity Pro**: Trend research and competitor analysis  
- **Multi-Agent System**: Full design brief → concept → delivery workflow

## 🔹 **Practical Recommendation**

Start with **both**:

1. **Use Perplexity Pro** for your research needs (it's brilliant at this)
2. **Build multi-agent system** with CrewAI for business automation
3. **Integrate them**: Make Perplexity your research agent's primary tool

**Week 1 Setup:**
```
Perplexity Pro → Research everything about multi-agent systems
CrewAI → Build your first 3-agent crew
Integration → Use Perplexity's API in your research agent
```

**The Truth:** Perplexity Pro won't replace multi-agent systems, but it'll make your research agents **incredibly powerful**. 

Think of it as having the best researcher on your team, while CrewAI gives you the entire team structure to scale your business.
